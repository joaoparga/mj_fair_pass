  abstract = {This article examines the attempts by John Rawls in the works published after "Political Liberalism" to engage with some of the feminist responses to his work. Rawls goes a long way toward addressing some of the major feminist-liberal concerns. Yet this has the unintended consequence of pushing justice as fairness in the direction of a more comprehensive, rather than a strictly political, form of liberalism. This does not seem to be a problem peculiar to Rawls: rather, any form of liberalism hospitable to feminist concerns must be, at the very least, a partly comprehensive, rather than a strictly political, doctrine.},

  abstract = {In a globally connected world and increasingly smart cities, the demand for living in a physical neighborhood where one can walk and cycle among familiar people and a variety of services is always alive. It is a quality of life which meets the deep desire of community and place identity. In this regard, the 15-minutes city is the contemporary version of the classical ``human measure''. The model offers a refreshing chrono-centric vision for the city that prioritizes people's time, energy and physio-psychological health by relieving their daily commutes. The recent pandemic clearly showed this potential; the daily outdoor movement by soft mobility allowed for social life even during lockdown periods. The paper is subdivided into two main components: a theoretical discussion of the 15-minute city model as part of a broader sustainable urban planning narrative, and a practical application mapping the potentials of Milan as a 15-minute city, focusing on population distribution and urban fabric structure as a measure of performance evaluation. The emergence of the 15-minute model rebalances the building volume concentration of the consolidated Transit Oriented Development paradigm; suggesting an innovative and more articulated vision. The 15-minute approach, rooted in the organic planning of the `60, is pushed by the covid-19 emergency, making treasure of the experience of urban regeneration masterplans of the last decade. The approach falls in line with real estate strategies for place making, which aim to create new sustainable urban districts that are pedestrian oriented and carbon free. After interpreting the international framework of urbanism trends with respect to the 15-minute model, the paper focuses on the Milan case. The potentials for neighborhoods across the city of Milan is investigated to conform to an inclusive 15-minute city model, using fully-fledged and innovative mapping of proximity. This analysis aims to explore the resilience of urban resources to support walkable living environments with a guaranteed basic level of accessibility to daily needs by walking. The support to this model offered by soft mobility modes and micro-mobility devices is also raised. The results show, in a number of urban neighborhoods, a limited level of walkability although related to a spatial city structure which is able to be regenerated as a dense and effective network of 15-minute neighborhoods through tactical urbanism actions on existing open spaces and soft mobility policies, combined with long term strategies (infrastructure capacity and digital upgrading). It is a first methodological test which opens up the research towards a new inclusive concept of accessibility.},

To better understand factors that influence driving decisions and to identify approaches that could help ease the transition to a non-driving status, we conducted focus groups with elders who had recently stopped driving. Results demonstrate that the decision to stop driving is reluctantly made by elders on their own or after prompting from others. While all have other means of transportation, a sense of loss of independence remains. Participants urged policy makers to address older driver issues and were proponents of developing procedures to identify at-risk drivers. They also stressed the importance of making plans for retirement from driving. Findings suggest that while there is ``life after driving,'' efforts are needed to help older drivers, and their families develop a plan for driving cessation that includes identifying the appropriate time to stop and acceptable transportation alternatives to driving.},

  abstract = {Numerous urban models are emerging in response to climate urgencies, as pointed out in COP26, resulting in a call for urgent and deep decarbonization policies. One emerging model, responsive to the need for more sustainable urban outcomes, is that of the `15-Minute City'. The quest for more sustainable and smarter cities is urgent, as cities contribute more than 60\% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and thus demands a redefinition of some contemporary urban policies, especially around mobility. The `15-Minute City' is an emerging concept, currently in application in major European Cities, such as Paris and Barcelona, and quickly gaining popularity as a potent solution for encouraging urban sustainability transitions. As the model approaches urban planning via humane socio-economic dimensions, it can be further developed to benefit urban communities, globally in an equitable fashion. In doing so, the model can be crafted to respond to the challenges of the other geographies, including those of the Global South, specifically relating to urban infrastructural financing. This approach recognizes the need for models that can contribute to deep decarbonization agendas, while being contextually responsive with sound financial mechanisms\textemdash including both Public and Private parties. In this paper, we argue that the '15-Minute City' concept can be poised as a potent solution to re-structure cities for increased sustainability, inclusivity, and economic equity, through locally implemented fiscal mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Low-income residents are often reliant on public transit for daily travel. In North American cities, they have also historically concentrated in centrally located neighbourhoods with relatively higher levels of transit accessibility. However, during the late 20th and early 21st century, regions have witnessed trends of inner-city neighbourhood change and gentrification and the suburbanization of poverty, raising concerns that low-income residents are disproportionately moving away from relied upon transit service. In this paper, we investigate what occurs when low-income residents change dwellings within a region: do they experience a reduction in their levels of transit accessibility, how does this compare to higher-income movers, and how has this changed over time? We examine this by linking historical transit accessibility measures to annual individual-level panel data representing 20\% of tax filers in Toronto, Canada from 1988 to 2018. We then analyze changes in transit accessibility for over 2 million intra-urban movers during this time period via descriptive statistics and regression models to answer whether there are significant differences in individual changes in transit accessibility by income level. We find that low-income residents do, on average, experience reductions in their levels of transit accessibility when moving within the region, suggesting a growth in people at risk of transport poverty. Nevertheless, they do not undergo as great of a reduction in transit accessibility as higher-income movers, although this gap in experienced changes in transit accessibility between higher- and low-income movers is converging over time.},

In this article, we develop a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modeling and accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation networks and travel behavior, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the number of opportunities. We use this method to compute access to employment for Canada's eight largest cities to comparatively examine inequalities in accessibility, both within and between cities, and by travel mode.}

This paper provides a framework and an empirical investigation in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) examining the links between public transit accessibility and the risks of social exclusion, simply understood as the suppressed ability to conduct daily activities at normal levels. Specifically, we use a large-sample travel survey to present a new transport-geography concept termed participation deserts, neighbourhood-level clusters of lower than expected activity participation. We then use multivariate models to estimate where, and for whom, improvements in transit accessibility will effectively increase activity participation and reduce risks of transport-related social exclusion. Our results show that neighbourhoods with high concentrations of low-income and zero-car households located outside of major transit corridors are the most sensitive to having improvements in accessibility increase daily activity participation rates. We contend that transit investments providing better connections to these neighbourhoods would have the greatest benefit in terms of alleviating existing inequalities and reducing the risks of social exclusion. The ability for transport investments to liberate suppressed activity participation is not currently being predicted or valued in existing transport evaluation methodologies, but there is great potential in doing so in order to capture the social equity benefits associated with increasing transit accessibility.},

A potential negative impact of these trends is that low-income populations are concentrating in more automobile-oriented areas, resulting in increased barriers to daily travel and activity participation, particularly for those who are unable to afford a private vehicle. Accordingly, the objective of this article is to analyze the links between increasing sociospatial inequalities, transport disadvantage, and adverse travel behavior outcomes. This is examined first from a theoretical perspective and second via a spatiotemporal analysis for the Toronto region from 1991 to 2016. Findings show that many suburban areas in Toronto are not only declining in socioeconomic status but are also suffering from increased barriers to daily travel evidenced by longer commute times and decreasing activity participation rates, relative to central neighborhoods. Because of these adverse effects, this evidence further supports the need for progressive planning and policy aimed at curbing continuing trends of suburbanization of poverty while also improving levels of transport accessibility in the suburbs.},

The Programa Bolsa Fam\'ilia (PBF) the  Brazilian conditional cash transfer programme, established in 2004, aims to  attenuate the effects of poverty of Brazilians. Our study aims to evaluate the  effect of Bolsa Fam\'ilia Programme (BFP) coverage on suicide rates in Brazilian  municipalities. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study using 2004-2012 panel data  for 5507 Brazilian municipalities. We calculated age-standardized suicide rates for  each municipality and year. BFP coverage was categorized according to three levels  ({$<$}\,30\%, {$\geq$}\,30\% and {$<$}\,70\% and {$\geq$}\,70\%) and duration (coverage\,{$\leq$}\,70\% for all years, {$\geq$}\,70\%  for 1~year, {$\geq$}\,70\% for 2~years, {$\geq$}\,70\% for 3 or more years). We used negative binomial  regression models with fixed effects, adjusting for socio-economic, demographic and  social welfare co-variables. RESULTS: An increase in BFP coverage was associated  with a reduction in suicide rates. The strongest effect was observed when in  addition to greater municipal coverage (RR 0.942, 95\% CI 0.936-0.947), the duration  of the high coverage was maintained for 3 years or more (RR 0.952 95\% CI  0.950-0.954). CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that the conditional cash  transfer programme may reduce suicide in Brazilian municipalities, mitigating the  effect of poverty on suicide incidence.},

In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences approach to examine the causal effect of highway concessions on road safety outcomes using daily data from Brazilian Federal highways over 11 years between 2007 and 2017. We exploit the transition from public to private management in some but not all Brazilian states to provide both within- and between-states comparison. We find that concessions promote a small but significant reduction in the number and fatality of road crashes as well as and the number of people and vehicles involved in crashes. Between 2007 and 2017, procured roads had on average 16 fewer deaths then publicly managed highways for every 1000 crashes each year. These road safety benefits only become statistically significant a few years after a concession implementation, but they are marginally larger for every additional year of concession. Finally, our results suggest that including safety-based incentives in concession contracts can substantially improve road safety performance. The findings of the paper have important implications for the social and economic evaluation of road concessions and for road infrastructure policy more broadly.},

However, travel can be constrained by the lack of good transport or by personal factors. This paper investigates whether these constraints are associated with poor self-rated health, and the extent to which the association is mediated by reduced social participation. Method Respondents in a survey in the North of England (n~=~2747) stated levels of constraints to trip frequency, number of places visited, travel distance, and travel mode for trips more than 15 miles (24~km) away from home. Path analysis tested associations between these constraints, indicators of social participation (seeing family and friends frequently and being a member of clubs or societies), and self-rated health. Results Constraints to the number of places visited were associated with self-rated health via reduced social participation. Constraints to trip frequency had a negative association with self-rated health via pathways other than social participation. Constraints to travel distance were not significant and constraints to car use and public transport use were associated with self-rated health via other constraints. The results varied by age group and were robust to changes in variable specification and treatment of missing data. Conclusions The results confirm the importance of being able to travel outside the local area for social participation and health and emphasize the need for public policies that reduce constraints to travel, by providing better conditions for the use of both private and public transport and for the realization of more frequent trips to a wider set of places.},

Results: As expected, global self-rated health declines with age in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.

Conclusions: The age-trajectory of global self-rated health is similar in individuals and populations. For comparative self-rated health, however, the individual on average experiences a slight decline, whereas on the population level comparative self-rated health either increases or remains stable. The explanation for this is likely to be higher mortality and higher non-response among the participants with the poorest self-rated health.},

  abstract = {Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Achieving UHC will require strong health systems to promote and  deliver equitable and integrated healthcare services through primary healthcare  (PHC). In Brazil, the Family Health Strategy (FHS) delivers PHC through the public  health system. Created in 1994, the FHS covered almost 123 million individuals (63\%  of the Brazilian population) by 2015. The FHS has been associated with many health  improvements, but gaps in coverage still remain. This article examines factors  associated with the implementation and expansion of the FHS across 5419 Brazilian  municipalities from 1998 to 2012. The proportion of the municipal population covered  by the FHS over time was assessed using a longitudinal multilevel model for change  that accounted for variables covering eight domains: economic development,  healthcare supply, healthcare needs/access, availability of other sources of  healthcare, political context, geographical isolation, regional characteristics and  population size. Data were obtained from multiple publicly available sources. During  the 15-year study period, national coverage of the FHS increased from 4.4\% to 54\%,  with 58\% of the municipalities having population coverage of 95\% or more, and  municipalities that had not adopted the programme decreased from 86.4\% to 4.9\%. The  increase in FHS uptake and coverage was not homogenous across municipalities, and  was positively associated with small population size, low population density, low  coverage of private health insurance, low level of economic development, alignment  of the political party of the Mayor and the state Governor, and availability of  healthcare supply. Efforts to expand the FHS coverage will need to focus on  increasing the availability of health personnel, devising financial incentives for  municipalities to uptake/expand the FHS and devising new policies that encompass  both private and public sectors.},

Researchers should therefore check whether the assumptions encoded in the DAG are consistent with the data before proceeding with the analysis.

  abstract = {The pioneering work of Getis and Ord on local spatial statistics has a counterpart in spatial econometrics in treating spatial heterogeneity. This can be approached from a continuous or a discrete perspective. In a discrete perspective, referred to as spatial regimes, the coefficients vary by discrete subregions of the data. Whereas the estimation of spatial regime regressions is well understood, the delineation of the regimes themselves remains a topic of active interest. Generally speaking, two broad classes of methods can be distinguished, one in which the delineation is carried out separately from the coefficient estimation and one where the two are tightly integrated. Tightly integrated approaches are referred to as endogenous spatial regimes. A number of different methods have been suggested in the literature, including finite mixture models, GWR-based methods, and penalized regression. One drawback of regime delineation is that the results do not necessarily satisfy a spatial contiguity constraint, i.e., observations are grouped despite not being spatially connected. In this paper, we outline a heuristic to determine the spatial regimes endogenously, as an extension of the well-known SKATER algorithm for spatially constrained clustering. This guarantees that the resulting regimes consist of contiguous observations. We outline the method and apply it in the context of the determination of housing submarkets, which is represented by rich literature in applied spatial econometrics. We use a well-known Kaggle data set as the empirical example, which contains observations on house sales in King County, Washington. We compare the estimation of a hedonic house price model using the endogenous spatial regimes approach to a range of more traditional methods, including pooled regression, the use of administrative districts, data-driven regimes based on a-spatial and spatial clustering of explanatory variables, and finite mixture regression. We evaluate the results in terms of fit and assess the trade-offs between the spatial and a-spatial approaches.},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ?outliers,? as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.}

However, little research has examined directly access to transportation in analyses of rural health care utilization. Purpose: This analysis addresses the association of transportation and health care utilization in a rural region. Methods: Using survey data from a sample of 1,059 households located in 12 western North Carolina counties, this analysis tests the relationship of different transportation measures to health care utilization while adjusting for the effects of personal characteristics, health characteristics, and distance. Findings: Those who had a driver's license had 2.29 times more health care visits for chronic care and 1.92 times more visits for regular checkup care than those who did not. Respondents who had family or friends who could provide transportation had 1.58 times more visits for chronic care than those who did not. While not significant in the multivariate analysis, the small number who used public transportation had 4 more chronic care visits per year than those who did not. Age and lower health status were also associated with increased health care visits. The transportation variables that were significantly associated with health care visits suggest that the underlying conceptual frameworks, the Health Behavior Model and Hagerstrand's time geography, are useful for understanding transportation behavior. Conclusions: Further research must address the transportation behavior related to health care and the factors that influence this behavior. This information will inform policy alternatives to address geographic barriers to health care in rural communities.},

  abstract = {During the past three decades a large body of research has investigated the problem of specifying class intervals for choropleth maps. This work, however, has focused almost exclusively on placing observations in quasi-continuous data distributions into ordinal bins along the number line. All enumeration units that fall into each bin are then assigned an areal symbol that is used to create the choropleth map. The geographical characteristics of the data are only indirectly considered by such approaches to classification. In this article, we design, implement, and evaluate a new approach to classification that places class-interval selection into a multicriteria framework. In this framework, we consider not only number\textendash line relationships, but also the area covered by each class, the fragmentation of the resulting classifications, and the degree to which they are spatially autocorrelated. This task is accomplished through the use of a genetic algorithm that creates optimal classifications with respect to multiple criteria. These results can be evaluated and a selection of one or more classifications can be made based on the goals of the cartographer. An interactive software tool to support classification decisions is also designed and described.},

However, these tools are not universally required in jurisdictions, and this Forum intervention considers whether these technical tools might be reshaped to integrate Indigenous communities' interests, with specific attention to traditional knowledge. Challenges include unrealistic timelines to evaluate proposed projects, community capacity, inadequate understanding of Indigenous communities, and ineffective communicatio, all of which contribute to pervasive distrust in EAs by many Indigenous communities. Despite efforts to address these problems, substantive inequities persist in the way that EAs are conducted as infringement continues on constitutionally protected Indigenous rights.

This paper argues for the special position of housing equity in inequality dynamics while challenging a persistent ``ideology of mass homeownership'' as a widespread and equalizing mechanism of asset accumulation. Contemporary dynamics of diminished homeownership access contrast to the continued attractiveness of real estate among those with capital and recent growths in private landlordism. The research presents an explorative examination of the housing wealth dimension of inequality through the British case and assesses empirically the dimensions of: equity concentration, inter and intra-generational divergences, and the role of private landlordism. The research points to the starkly concentrated nature of housing equity and significant trends towards increasing disparities, with especially disadvantaged prospects among younger cohorts. The recent emergence of a substantial secondary rental-property market presents a further key dimension of wealth concentration. The research underscores the fundamental inequality of housing equity and brings into question rooted ideologies of housing-asset-based economic security in an era of individualized welfare responsibility.},

  abstract = {The concept of decolonization has been used in numerous disciplines and settings, including education, psychology, governance, justice, transitional justice, restorative justice as well as research methods. Fanon (1963) saw decolonization as a process of both unlearning and undoing the harms of colonization. For Monchalin (2016), decolonization is both a goal and process to bring about a fundamental shift in colonial structures, ideologies and discourses. According to Alfred (2009, p. 185), decolonization requires ``nation-to-nation partnership'' for ``justice and peace''. In the context of Restorative Justice (RJ), decolonization entail a) addressing historical harms of colonization; b) recognizing grievances of indigenous and marginalized communities about the justice system as genuine; and c) acknowledging ~that state- or INGO-funded RJ practices may do more harm than good. This paper begins with a brief overview of decolonization discourses from micro and macro perspectives to then locate decolonization in justice settings, arguing against ``copying and pasting'' Eurocentric models of RJ practices. Grounded in the findings of RJ visionaries and practitioners in Bangladesh and the work of Cunneen (2002), and Tauri and Morris (1997), this study proposes a decolonizing framework for RJ practices.},

In this way, we are able to measure the long run effects of income changes. Under the assumption that the user is the final beneficiary of the subsidies, and computing the share of the fare that is subsidized, we measure the progressiveness of the subsidies for different income groups and city sizes. Urban public transport subsidies are shown to be progressive. In larger urban areas this effect is considerably more important than in small ones.}

  abstract = {We conducted an extensive set of empirical analyses to examine the effect of the number of events per variable (EPV) on the relative performance of three different methods for assessing the predictive accuracy of a logistic regression model: apparent performance in the analysis sample, split-sample validation, and optimism correction using bootstrap methods. Using a single dataset of patients hospitalized with heart failure, we compared the estimates of discriminatory performance from these methods to those for a very large independent validation sample arising from the same population. As anticipated, the apparent performance was optimistically biased, with the degree of optimism diminishing as the number of events per variable increased. Differences between the bootstrap-corrected approach and the use of an independent validation sample were minimal once the number of events per variable was at least 20. Split-sample assessment resulted in too pessimistic and highly uncertain estimates of model performance. Apparent performance estimates had lower mean squared error compared to split-sample estimates, but the lowest mean squared error was obtained by bootstrap-corrected optimism estimates. For bias, variance, and mean squared error of the performance estimates, the penalty incurred by using split-sample validation was equivalent to reducing the sample size by a proportion equivalent to the proportion of the sample that was withheld for model validation. In conclusion, split-sample validation is inefficient and apparent performance is too optimistic for internal validation of regression-based prediction models. Modern validation methods, such as bootstrap-based optimism correction, are preferable. While these findings may be unsurprising to many statisticians, the results of the current study reinforce what should be considered good statistical practice in the development and validation of clinical prediction models.},

To attain such plausibility, it must avoid four potentially debilitating problems: ambiguity, arbitrariness, underdemandingness, and blindness to important values other than sufficiency. Critics think these problems are inescapably a part of sufficientarian views. This chapter claims that sufficientarians can avoid these critiques by including three elements. First, the threshold must be built around a ``thick'' concept to avoid ambiguity so as to be able to function as a political principle. Second, it should not be set at too low a level in order to avoid being unreasonably underdemanding while still avoiding arbitrariness. Finally, it must embrace aspect pluralism to incorporate nondistributive values. Such a threshold may plausibly be constructed around the value of a flourishing life, and this involves securing that people are sufficiently well off in (at least) three separate aspects of human life.},

The meaning of economic theory and applied work and the boundaries between them changed as theory and empirical work alike became more applied in the sense that they were brought to bear on specific social issues, often with a policy orientation. Drawing on an analysis of John Bates Clark medal winners and on papers published in a special volume of History of Political Economy, to which this is an introduction, we then discuss reasons for this transformation. It resulted from new modeling strategies, data sets, and technologies as well as the changing influence of public and private patrons.},

Accurate transport network models can be used in a variety of applications either in transport simulation models or autonomous vehicles navigation. Although two relevant literature reviews were performed during the last decade, they were not systematic and did not explore the road network inference methods from a transport network modelling point of view. The objective of this research is to perform a systematic and reproducible literature review on the use GPS data in transport network modelling and provide limitations and future work to extract a road network representation for transport models and autonomous vehicles navigation. This was done by systematically examining the studies' different approaches with respect to relevant criteria. Most studies produced a simple representation of the road network, not detailed enough for transport models. Other limitations were the bias introduced by the GPS sample and the reproducibility of the different methods.},

Key issues in measuring ridership change resulting from BRT include (1) understanding stop-level- rather than corridor-level change; (2) examining the ridership impacts of new infrastructure where there is no comparable pre-BRT infrastructure; and (3) assessing piecemeal implementation of BRT. To address these issues, we undertook a quasi-experimental study using agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC), propensity score matching (PSM), and t-tests with Cohen?s d to determine BRT?s causal ridership impact. The use of AHC and PSM in what we refer to as cluster-level modeling provided an improved method for measuring causal ridership change at the stop cluster level in areas with no pre-BRT stations. The results revealed no statistical evidence that BRT caused increased transit ridership for stop clusters directly along the BRT corridor. However, the results did indicate that stop clusters for routes connecting to a BRT station experienced an increase in transit ridership. The importance of such findings is grounded in understanding that a limited number of stops along a single corridor may not be enough to affect transit ridership, yet BRT?s flexibility in being able to operate off the BRT corridor does enhance transit ridership.}

However, turning these demands for better evidence about interventions around the social determinants of health into action requires identifying what we already know and highlighting areas for further development. Methods Systematic review methodology was used to identify systematic reviews (from 2000 to 2007, developed countries only) that described the health effects of any intervention based on the wider social determinants of health: water and sanitation, agriculture and food, access to health and social care services, unemployment and welfare, working conditions, housing and living environment, education, and transport. Results Thirty systematic reviews were identified. Generally, the effects of interventions on health inequalities were unclear. However, there is suggestive systematic review evidence that certain categories of intervention may impact positively on inequalities or on the health of specific disadvantaged groups, particularly interventions in the fields of housing and the work environment. Conclusion Intervention studies that address inequalities in health are a priority area for future public health research.},

In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the "cultural turn" or the "new economic geography." I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.},

  abstract = {The combined decentralisation of many firms and services and the increasing concentration of traditional public transport services in the main corridors of urban centres have made it more difficult for people to access jobs, in particular when residing outside these prime accessibility areas. This is the first national study within the context of Great Britain to examine whether better public transport job accessibility, modelled at the micro level of individuals, improves employment probabilities for people living in Great Britain. While previous studies have typically concentrated on US metropolitan areas, our study uses British national employment micro datasets to assess which urban and rural areas and population groups would benefit from better public transport services. In an important departure from most standard accessibility methodologies, we computed a public transport job accessibility measure applied nationwide and combined this with individual-level employment probability models for Great Britain. The models were corrected for endogeneity by applying an instrumental variable approach. The study finds that better public transport job accessibility improves individual employment probabilities, in particular in metropolitan areas and smaller cities and towns with lower car ownership rates and in low-income neighbourhoods. It further shows that mainly lower educated groups and young people would benefit from better public transport job accessibility. The findings in this study are important for policymakers in that they imply that, in particular, job seekers who rely on public transport services may benefit from more targeted public policies to improve their accessibility to employment and thereby their social mobility.}

  abstract = {The role of transport in providing access to employment has received considerable attention. Since transport policies may be motivated by assumed effects on employment probability outcomes, it is important to establish the nature of the relationship between transport and employment outcomes. While the majority of the empirical evidence suggests a positive association, it is not conclusive or consistent and often shows mixed results. To address this confusion, our study has systematically reviewed this evidence base and synthesised it through meta-analysis. We first identified 93 studies that quantitatively assessed the impact of transport on employment outcomes. By systematically merging the empirical evidence, this study establishes a positive association between transport and employment outcomes, with varying effects for four identified categories of transport measures (or combinations thereof): car ownership, public transport access, commute times, and job accessibility levels. This positive association persists in studies that control for endogeneity between transport and employment, but a larger evidence base is needed to establish a more robust relationship, in particular for cities and smaller (rural) areas outside the US-context and with regard to public transport. We then selected 20 methodologically comparable studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Our meta-regression models clearly demonstrate that car ownership significantly increases individual employment probabilities, in particular among welfare recipients. Young drivers benefit from access to household cars when these are not in use by their parents, and they are more sensitive to the time and cost implications of longer commutes. While our systematic review suggests that better access to public transport and higher levels of job accessibility increases employment probabilities, meta-regression analysis requires more consistent transport measures. The findings in this study are important for policymakers in that they imply that job seekers may benefit from public policies targeted at improving their access to public transport, in particular for people without access to cars and in areas with fewer job opportunities.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical and empirical studies show that there is a growing interest in considering wider social and economic impacts of transport. Since transport has an important role in distributing socio-economic benefits or losses created by different means or by transport itself, it has a crucial role in the discussion of social justice. This importance occurs from transport's different effects depending on the levels or the types of equity in the distribution: transport can help develop socially just societies or cause disparities between different or within same geographies. Therefore, for the system to be efficient, the distribution needs to be socially just. This paper provides a synthesis of social justice and transport literature in terms of equal rights and shares, freedom, capabilities, opportunities and choices by making use of contemporary approaches in the social justice theory and considering the varieties in different geographies, individuals and markets. Using the Capability Approach (CA), this paper first highlights the areas which need to be discussed in transport studies in terms of social justice, and second suggests a methodology which considers social justice norms in transport research by engaging the CA with existing methods.},

Results show substantial variation in the amount of walking across study areas. Trips are shorter and more likely to be via walking in centres. A key to the centres' increased walking travel is the concentration of local shopping and service destinations in a commercial core. Yet the amount of business concentration that is associated with highly pedestrian-oriented neighbourhoods is from three to four times as large as what can be supported by the local resident base, suggesting that pedestrian-oriented neighbourhoods necessarily import shopping trips, and hence driving trips, from larger surrounding catchment areas. The results suggest both land use and mobility strategies that can be appropriate for suburban regions.},

Against this background, developing and evaluating indicators that quantify the distribution of public transport services from a social equity perspective is essential. The aim of the study is, therefore, to assess the equity of public transport services in four metropolitan regions in Brazil (S\~ao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba and Recife) with two commonly used indicators of public transport provision. The first indicator measures proximity to rapid transit infrastructure (bus rapid transit, light rail and heavy rail stops with high frequency throughout the day), and the second measures accessibility to jobs by public transport. While simple indicators of proximity to public transport stops are most commonly used given their ease of operationalization and communication, accessibility to job indicators are more representative of the benefits provided to individuals by the public transport network. Combining these two indicators in one study provides a quantitative assessment of the socio-spatial distribution of public transport services in four large metropolitan areas in Brazil and the results demonstrate that lower-income households are disadvantaged in terms of public transport services in all four metropolitan areas. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of quantifying accessibility by public transport, in addition to proximity to rapid transit, and thereby sheds light on the importance of developing openly available public transport schedules and geographic data. This study is of relevance to planners and researchers wishing to measure and evaluate public transport equity in the Global South.},

  abstract = {Public transport ridership has been steadily increasing since the early 2000s in many urban areas in North America. However, many cities have more recently seen their transit ridership plateaued, if not decreased. This trend in transit ridership has produced a lot of discussion on which factors contributed the most to this new trend. While no recent study has been conducted on this matter, understanding the levers that can be used to sustain and/or increase transit ridership is essential. The aim of this study is, therefore, to explore the determinants of public transport ridership from 2002 to 2015 for 25 transit authorities in Canada and the United States using a longitudinal multilevel mixed-effect regression approach. Our analysis demonstrates that vehicle revenue kilometers (VRK) and car ownership are the main determinants of transit ridership. More specifically, the results suggest that the reduction in bus VRK likely explains the reduction in ridership observed in recent years in many North American cities. Furthermore, external factors such as the presence of ridesourcing services (Uber) and bicycle sharing, although not statistically significant in our models, are associated with higher levels of transit ridership, which contradicts some of the experts' hypotheses. From a policy perspective, this research suggests that investments in public transport operations, especially bus services, can be a key factor to mitigate the decline in transit ridership or sustain and increase it. While the results of this study emphasize that fare revenues cannot support such investments without deterring ridership, additional sources of revenues are required. This study is of relevance to public transport engineers, planners, researchers, and policy-makers wishing to understand the factors leading to an increase in transit ridership.},

Through decades of development, critics and defenses of the capability of SEMs to support causal inference have accumulated. A variety of misunderstandings and myths about the nature of SEMs and their role in causal analysis have emerged, and their repetition has led some to believe they are true. Our chapter is organized by presenting eight myths about causality and SEMs in the hope that this will lead to a more accurate understanding. More specifically, the eight myths are the following: (1) SEMs aim to establish causal relations from associations alone, (2) SEMs and regression are essentially equivalent, (3) no causation without manipulation, (4) SEMs are not equipped to handle nonlinear causal relationships, (5) a potential outcome framework is more principled than SEMs, (6) SEMs are not applicable to experiments with randomized treatments, (7) mediation analysis in SEMs is inherently noncausal, and (8) SEMs do not test any major part of the theory against the data. We present the facts that dispel these myths, describe what SEMs can and cannot do, and briefly present our critique of current practice using SEMs. We conclude that the current capabilities of SEMs to formalize and implement causal inference tasks are indispensible; its potential to do more is even greater.},

Design British cross sectional population survey of people aged 65 and over. Participants 999 people aged 65 plus living at home in Britain. Results Regression modelling showed that high self efficacy had a strong independent association with better self rated health status and physical functioning. Indicators of perceived neighbourhood environment that showed strong associations with both good health and functioning were: perceptions of good quality facilities in the area (social/leisure, facilities for people aged 65+, rubbish collection, health services, transport, closeness to shops, somewhere nice to walk), and high levels of neighbourliness (knows/trusts people). Perceptions of problems in the area (noise, crime, air quality, rubbish/litter, traffic, graffiti) were also predictive of poorer health. Measures of social contact and support did not show any independent associations with health or functioning. Conclusions The unique value of this paper is in the simultaneous analysis of associations between perceived neighbourhood, social contact and support, self efficacy, and health. The consistent strength of older people's perceptions of the quality of facilities in their neighbourhoods shows that responsive reinforcement of local infrastructures might have wider health benefits. Also of interest was the strength of self efficacy as a predictor of self rated health and physical functioning. The results have implications for both neighbourhood level interventions and self management programmes in chronic illness.},

  abstract = {The proportional odds model for ordinal logistic regression provides a useful extension of the binary logistic model to situations where the response variable takes on values in a set of ordered categories. The model may be represented by a series of logistic regressions for dependent binary variables, with common regression parameters reflecting the proportional odds assumption. Key to the valid application of the model is the assessment of the proportionality assumption. An approach is described arising from comparisons of the separate (correlated) fits to the binary logistic models underlying the overall model. Based on asymptotic distributional results, formal goodness-of-fit measures are constructed to supplement informal comparisons of the different fits. A number of proposals, including application of bootstrap simulation, are discussed and illustrated with a data example.},

To date, however, quantitative evidence of disparities in access to bike lanes has been limited to a small number of cities. We addressed this research gap by examining cross-sectional associations between bike lanes and sociodemographic characteristics at the block group level for 22 large U.S. cities (n\,=\,21,843 block groups). Dependent variables included the presence (yes/no), coverage, connectivity, and proximity of bike lanes, measured using secondary GIS data collected by each of the 22 cities between 2012 and 2016. Primary independent variables included indicators of race, ethnicity, educational attainment, income, poverty, and a composite socioeconomic status (SES) index, all measured using data from the 2011\textendash 2015 American Community Survey. We used linear and logistic multilevel mixed-effects regression models to estimate associations between these sociodemographic characteristics and each bike lane dependent variable, before and after adjusting for traditional indicators of cycling demand (population and employment density, distance to downtown, population age structure, bicycle commuting levels). In unadjusted associations, disadvantaged block groups (i.e. lower SES, higher proportions of minority residents) had significantly lower access to bike lanes. After adjusting for indicators of cycling demand, access to bike lanes was lower in block groups with particular types of disadvantage (lower educational attainment, higher proportions of Hispanic residents, lower composite SES) but not in those with other types of disadvantage (higher proportions of black residents, lower income, higher poverty). These results provide empirical support for advocates' claims of disparities in bike lane access, suggesting the importance of more closely considering social equity in bicycle planning and advocacy.},

We use ``medical care'' rather than ``health care'' to refer to clinical services, to avoid potential confusion between ``health'' and ``health care.'' The World Health Organization's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health has defined SDH as ``the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age'' and ``the fundamental drivers of these conditions.'' The term ``social determinants'' often evokes factors such as health-related features of neighborhoods (e.g., walkability, recreational areas, and accessibility of healthful foods), which can influence health-related behaviors. Evidence has accumulated, however, pointing to socioeconomic factors such as income, wealth, and education as the fundamental causes of a wide range of health outcomes. This article broadly reviews some of the knowledge accumulated to date that highlights the importance of social\textemdash and particularly socioeconomic\textemdash factors in shaping health, and plausible pathways and biological mechanisms that may explain their effects. We also discuss challenges to advancing this knowledge and how they might be overcome.},

Self-reported height, weight, physical activity and travel behaviours were obtained from the household heads in each neighbourhood type. No direct association was detected between neighbourhood type and BMI. However, household heads of single-family dwellings in the new urbanist neighbourhood have lower BMI partly due to the number of utilitarian trips made by walking or bicycling. This relationship is independent of physical activity time. Although small in magnitude, this association may have appreciable morbidity effects at the population level.},

We constructed multilevel models to evaluate the relationship between the neighborhood SES index and self-rated health for people with and without chronic conditions, after adjustment for other individual characteristics. Results. Having a chronic condition was associated with substantially poorer self-rated health among participants in a deprived area than among those in a more advantaged area. Conclusions. Residence in a disadvantaged neighborhood may be associated with barriers to the management of a chronic condition. Further work is needed to identify the specific characteristics of disadvantaged areas associated with poorer self-rated health for adults with chronic conditions.},

Using the National Population Health Survey, this paper focuses upon the health status of the immigrant population relative to that of non-immigrants within Canada, with reference to diagnosed conditions, self-assessed health, and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3. Findings indicate that, with the exception of the most recent arrivals, immigrants experience worse health status across most dimensions relative to non-immigrants. Multivariate analysis reveals that age, income adequacy, gender, and home ownership are dimensions upon which health status differs between the two groups.},

  abstract = {While cities have become gradually more vertical and complex over the past century, our methods for conceptualising their characteristics and measuring their forms and functions are still largely based in a horizontal mindset. Recent work has sought to shift urban discourse towards understanding cities according to their volumetric properties. Moving the debate further, this paper approaches volumetric urbanism from a morphological perspective, setting out a research agenda that operationalises the concept as a means of better capturing the morphological characteristics of cities as volumetric entities. First, we deconstruct volumetric urbanism into the five basic building blocks that define volumetric morphologies: density, functional mix, compaction and compression, complex networks and interaction intensity. Next, we propose two methods for capturing the urban volumetrics of cities based on spatial and network interaction and apply them to a hypothetical case and a preliminary study of Hong Kong. We conclude by arguing that a volumetric approach is required to capture the complex form of compressed, multi-layered and highly connected cities. In response, urban morphological and planning discourses must move away from the horizontal analytical mindset, embrace a multi-layered three-dimensional view of cities and place greater emphasis on spatial configurations and network relations by measuring interaction.}

An exploratory factor analysis revealed six underlying dimensions of social capital for 7,187 adults living in Ontario, Canada. These factors included trust in people, neighbourhood social capital, trust in institutions, sense of belonging, civic engagement, and social network size. A logistic regression indicated that having high Trust in People and Trust in Institutions were associated with better mental health while high Trust in Institutions, Sense of Belonging, and Civic Engagement were associated with better physical health. When comparing rural and urban residents, there were no differences in their self-reported health, nor did social capital influence their health any differently, despite rural residents having higher social capital scores. The study findings are important for understanding the nature of social capital and how it influences health, and provide direction for targeted health promotion strategies.},

This study aims to propose sample size guidelines for logistic regression based on observational studies with large population. Methods We estimated the minimum sample size required based on evaluation from real clinical data to evaluate the accuracy between statistics derived and the actual parameters. Nagelkerke r-squared and coefficients derived were compared with their respective parameters. Results With a minimum sample size of 500, results showed that the differences between the sample estimates and the population was sufficiently small. Based on an audit from a medium size of population, the differences were within {$\pm$} 0.5 for coefficients and {$\pm$} 0.02 for Nagelkerke r-squared. Meanwhile for large population, the differences are within {$\pm$} 1.0 for coefficients and {$\pm$} 0.02 for Nagelkerke r-squared. Conclusions For observational studies with large population size that involve logistic regression in the analysis, taking a minimum sample size of 500 is necessary to derive the statistics that represent the parameters. The other recommended rules of thumb are EPV of 50 and formula; n = 100 + 50i where i refers to number of independent variables in the final model.},

  abstract = {Fare-free public transportation has recently gained attention from policymakers and has been proposed as a measure to reduce pollution and road congestion in several cities around the world. We investigate the impact of fare-free public transport on travel behavior by randomly assigning a pass to workers in Santiago (Chile). The pass allowed them unlimited travel for two weeks, as opposed to paying the regular fare of approximately US\$ 1 per trip. The main impact of fare-free public transport is an increase in overall travel of 12\%. We also find a 23\% increase in the total number of trips made during off-peak periods that is explained in equal shares by increases in public transport and non-motorized trips. Two-thirds of the aggregate effect on off-peak travel occurs during weekday off-peak periods and is mostly due to a 28\% increase in trips made by public transport. We find no evidence of mode or period substitution and that the effect on public transport trips is entirely explained by trips that use the subway and by individuals who live within one km. from a station.},

Using data from interview transcripts, we report on the affect (capacities to affect and be affected) within this space, to reveal the micropolitics of dissection. Analysis of the `dissection-assemblage' reveals how interactions between the living \textendash{} students, teachers, technicians \textendash{} and dead bodies not only produce knowledge and understanding of human anatomy but also show how the dead body gains new capacities to affect living bodies psychologically, emotionally and physiologically. While conventional humanist discussions of dissection have addressed how these interactions `de-humanise' and `re-humanise' the cadaver in this particular setting, this analysis discloses a complex micropolitics in which the conventional distinction between `living' and `dead' ignores the multiple ways in which all matter is vitally affective.},

  abstract = {Current UK housing policy favours high-density, mixed-use development on previously developed urban land. This ties in with a general policy to promote an 'urban renaissance', largely because of its claimed advantages for sustainability. However, there has been little testing to date of sustainability impacts in practice. This is particularly true for the social equity aspect of sustainability, despite its acknowledged centrality to the concept. This paper outlines the development of a theory of social equity in relation to urban form and presents empirical research based on this to test the case of the so-called 'compact city', that is, high-density, mixed-use urban form. The research involved a comparative investigation of a range of alleged social equity impacts in 25 medium-sized English cities of differing levels and types of compactness. The findings suggest that, in certain respects and with certain qualifications, the compact city has the potential to promote social equity. Likely benefits include reduced car dependency and lower levels of social segregation, while the main problem is likely to be a lack of affordable, decent-sized homes. Positive effects are emerging in response to re-urbanisation and development on derelict land, and the cities which most support equity appear to be those that have a large proportion of high-density housing and a large quantity of locally provided services and facilities.},

  abstract = {Objectives Neighborhood walkability is favorably related to multiple physical health outcomes, but associations with social health are less clear. Present analyses examined how neighborhood walkability was related to neighborhood social health and explored the potential confounding role of neighborhood self-selection. Methods Cross-sectional data were analyzed for 1745 adults, ages 20\textendash 66, recruited from two US regions. We created a walkability index around each participant's home (1~km street network buffer) based on residential density, street intersection density, mixed land use, and retail floor area ratio. Neighborhood social health outcomes included reported social interactions with neighbors and sense of community. Two mixed model regressions were conducted for each outcome, with and without adjusting for walkability-related reasons for moving to the neighborhood (self-selection). Covariates included sex, age, socioeconomic status, white/nonwhite race/ethnicity, marital status, and time living in the neighborhood. Results Neighborhood walkability was positively related to social interactions with neighbors, both without (b~=~0.13, p~{$<~$}.001) and with adjustment for self-selection (b~=~0.09, p~=~.008). Neighborhood walkability was positively associated with sense of community, but only before adjusting for self-selection (b~=~0.02, p~=~.009). Conclusion Neighborhood walkability may promote specific aspects of neighborhood social health, which together are beneficial for physical and mental health. These findings provide additional impetus for enhancing walkability of US communities.},

  abstract = {The concept of urban living is evolving, and there is a growing interest in creating smaller, more connected, and hyperlocal neighbourhoods, where everything people need is within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. This paper challenges the concept of the `15-minute city' as a panacea for urban ills, by exploring the history of utopian urban planning and regeneration aimed at creating sustainable, inclusive and vibrant communities by desegregating disadvantaged groups. Specifically, we examine social mixing policies, which are recurring top-down interventions that pathologise concentrated urban disadvantage. We trace the evolution of these policies in Europe from the Garden City movement to post-war social housing redevelopment to the current 15-minute city, which we consider to be social mix by stealth. While such policies can reduce the degree of concentrated disadvantage in the short term, they tend to be ineffective in the long term, as deprived neighbourhoods often remain so despite attempts to make them more diverse. The paper argues that the 15-minute city would be implemented through de facto social mix actions at the neighbourhood level, which are insufficient to address the deeper structural issues that perpetuate spatial inequality and deprivation. We propose that longitudinal and comparative analyses, combined with `right to the city' perspectives, should be considered in future research and policymaking to understand \textendash{} and more importantly address \textendash{} why urban renewal initiatives that aim for equitable outcomes at the neighbourhood scale ultimately fail to deliver.},

These measures, which include the number of opportunities available in an individual's activity space, are used to compare the levels of access between disabled and nondisabled groups and to determine if individuals' disabilities and other characteristics are contributing factors to their exclusion. Findings show that being young, coming from a small household, possessing a driver's license, having a steady job, living in an urban setting, and being willing to travel a long distance increase the number of opportunities available. {${_\ast}$}The author thanks the Greater Buffalo-Niagara Regional Transportation Council (GBNRTC) for providing the one-day travel diary used in this research via Dr. Daniel Hess (Planning Dept.

While limited-scale free-fare public transport (FFPT) services such as limited campaigns and fare evasion for special groups or specific services are prevalent, there is only limited evidence on the consequences of introducing a full-fledged FFPT. The case of Tallinn, Estonia offers a full-scale experiment that provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impacts of FFPT. This study examines travel pattern changes based on individual travel habit survey shortly before and almost 1~year after the introduction of FFPT policy in Tallinn based on interviews and travel diaries of a random sample of 1500 household. We analyse modal shift effects and whether they are driven by trip generation or trip substitution, travel attitudes and satisfactions as well as impacts on equity, employment prospects, and trip destination choices. Almost a year after the introduction of FFPT, public transport usage increased by 14~\% and there is evidence that the mobility of low-income residents has improved. The effect of FFPT on ridership is substantially lower than those reported in previous studies due to the good level of service provision, high public transport usage and low public transport fees that existed already prior to the FFPT.},

This study postulates that the land use and physical design characteristics of suburban workplaces have directly contributed to the decline in suburban mobility by inducing most employees to drive alone to work. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the low density, single-use, and nonintegrated character of many suburban office-commercial centers and corridors, combined with their tendency to provide plentiful, free parking, have compelled many workers to become dependent on their automobiles for accessing work and circulating within projects and these factors, combined with a sharp curtailment in new road construction and meager levels of suburban transit services, have led to unprecedented levels of congestion. While vehicles generally circulate freely once inside sprawling suburban office compounds, the reliance of most workers on their own automobiles to access job sites has all too often clogged connecting freeways and arterials. The emergence of suburban workplaces with densities equivalent to those of small downtowns, rich mixtures of land uses, pedestrian-friendly environments, and nearby affordable housing, it is argued, could do at least as much to mitigate congestion over the long run as any mix of traffic management or roadway expansion programs, and perhaps far more.},

This dispersal of jobs and commuting has been a mixed blessing of sorts.

  abstract = {Many new towns are planned as balanced, self-contained communities. This paper examines the association between how self-contained new towns are and how their residents and workers commute, drawing upon experiences in the US, the UK, metropolitan Paris and greater Stockholm. While American new towns are fairly self-contained, their commuting characteristics are largely indistinguishable from less-planned control communities. Britain's most recent new towns are highly balanced and self-contained, yet they are comparatively auto-dependent. By contrast, the rail-served new towns outside Paris and Stockholm are the least self-contained among the new towns studied; however, most external commutes are by rail transit or other non-auto modes. In general, there was an inverse relationship between self-containment and transit commuting in the European new towns studied. The paper concludes that other policies, like coordinated transit services, more strongly influence commuting choices among new town residents and workers than initiatives aimed at jobs-housing balance and self-sufficiency.},

  abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions \textemdash density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the `3Ds' affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing `walking quality' was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

Design Systematic review of the evidence in the research literature on the consequences of driving cessation in older adults. Setting Community. Participants Drivers aged 55 and older. Measurements Studies pertinent to the health consequences of driving cessation were identified through a comprehensive search of bibliographic databases. Studies that presented quantitative data for drivers aged 55 and older; used a cross-sectional, cohort, or case\textendash control design; and had a comparison group of current drivers were included in the review. Results Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Driving cessation was reported to be associated with declines in general health and physical, social, and cognitive function and with greater risks of admission to long-term care facilities and mortality. A meta-analysis based on pooled data from five studies examining the association between driving cessation and depression revealed that driving cessation almost doubled the risk of depressive symptoms in older adults (summary odds ratio = 1.91, 95\% confidence interval = 1.61\textendash 2.27). Conclusion Driving cessation in older adults appears to contribute to a variety of health problems, particularly depression. These adverse health consequences should be considered in making the decision to cease driving. Intervention programs ensuring mobility and social functions may be needed to mitigate the potential adverse effects of driving cessation on health and well-being in older adults.},

Transfers are a key component in the successful operation of an integrated system. The role of transfers is two-folds. First, transfers increase the accessibility of various destinations for users. Second, interchanges that facilitate transfers need to be provided in the network at strategic locations to reduce duplication of the PT routes; thus improving the reliability of the network. This work provides a comprehensive review of the studies focusing on mode switch to PT with emphasis on factors influencing commuters' willingness to make transfers. It is categorized into three perspectives: psychological, operational and policy. This qualitative systematic review reveals that the predominant focus of studies related to transfers has been on the operational aspect. The number of studies related to the psychological aspect and the effects of policies, on integrated systems, to encourage ridership of routes with transfers is limited. This is a major shortcoming in our current capability, as without a clear understanding of all three aspects, transfers are unlikely to be designed properly when developing an integrated multimodal system.},

It is argued that this urban-suburban contrast is explained by the concentration of black employment in predominantly black neighborhoods. Physical proximity to black workers and human capital considerations can account for a small percentage of this relationship. However, even after controlling for these factors, the effect of neighborhood racial composition on the percentage black of employment is quite substantial. These findings suggest that the suburbanization of work may adversely affect black employment, not so much by moving jobs outside of their feasible commuting range but by shifting jobs to areas of the city where black workers are at a higher risk of discrimination.},

While these changes in travel have been studied, less is known about how commute changes may have impacted individuals' body mass index (BMI). The present longitudinal study explores the relationship between commute mode and BMI of employed individuals in Montr\'eal, Canada. Methods This study uses panel data drawn from two waves of the Montr\'eal Mobility Survey (MMS) conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (n~=~458). BMI was modeled separately for women and men as a function of commuting mode, WalkScore\textcopyright, sociodemographic, and behavioral covariates using a multilevel regression modeling approach. Results For women, BMI significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but telecommuting frequency, and more specifically telecommuting as a replacement of driving, led to a statistically significant decrease in BMI. For men, higher levels of residential local accessibility decreased BMI, while telecommuting did not have a statistically significant effect on BMI. Conclusions This study's findings confirm previously observed gendered differences in the relations between the built environment, transport behaviors, and BMI, while offering new insights regarding the impacts of the changes in commute patterns linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since some of the COVID-19 impacts on commute are expected to be lasting, findings from this research can be of use by health and transport practitioners as they work towards generating policies that improve population health.},

  abstract = {Background Having sufficient healthcare access helps individuals proactively manage their health challenges, leading to positive long-term health outcomes. In the U.S., healthcare access is a public health issue as many Americans lack the physical or financial resources to receive the healthcare services they need. Mental healthcare is especially difficult due to lingering social stigmas and scarcity of services. Subsequently, those with mental health impairment tend to be complex patients, which may convolute delivery of services. Objective To quantify the prevalence of barriers to healthcare access among U.S. adults with and without mental health challenges (MHC) and evaluate the relationship between MHC and no usual source of care (NUSC). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with data from the 2017\textendash 2018 National Health Interview Survey. MHC was categorized into three levels: no (NPD), moderate (MPD) and severe (SPD) psychological distress. Eight barriers were quantified; one was used as the primary outcome: NUSC. Multivariable logistic regression was used to quantify associations between these characteristics. Results The sample included 50,103 adults. Most reported at least one barrier to healthcare access (95.6\%) while 13.3\% reported NUSC. For each barrier, rates were highest among those with SPD and lowest for those with NPD. However, in the multivariable model, SPD and MPD were not associated with NUSC (OR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 1.01; 0.88; 0.73\textendash 1.07). Male sex (1.92; 1.78\textendash 2.06), Hispanic race/ethnicity (1.59; 1.42\textendash 1.77), and worry to afford emergent (1.38; 1.26\textendash 150) or normal (1.60; 1.46\textendash 1.76) healthcare were associated with NUSC. Having a current partner (0.88; 0.80\textendash 0.96), dependent(s) (0.77; 0.70\textendash 0.85) and paid sick leave (0.60; 0.56\textendash 0.65) were protective. Conclusions The most prevalent barriers to healthcare access link to issues with affordability, and MHC exist more often when any barrier is reported. More work is needed to understand the acuity of burden as other social and environmental factors may hold effect.},

  abstract = {Can urban design improve the environment? If communities could be designed to reduce automobile use, then yes. But can urban design influence travel? Surprisingly perhaps, the effects of any specific neighborhood feature on travel behavior at the margin are all but unknown. The policy significance of this issue is reflected in the swelling popularity of the `new urbanism' and other planning strategies employing land use tools to mitigate the environmental impacts of metropolitan development. In addition to asserting that development patterns and densities affect how far, how often, and by what means people travel, urban designers frequently argue that the legibility and shape of the local street pattern play a key role. `Connected' residential blocks are thus associated with less driving by comparison with the circuitous routes of the modern suburban cul-de-sac\textemdash chiefly by reducing trip lengths and facilitating pedestrian and transit access. Remarkably, there is little empirical and theoretical support for these claims. This paper provides the first direct tests of these hypotheses within a consistent behavioral framework. An analysis of household travel diary and GIS data for San Diego finds little role for land use in explaining travel behavior, and no evidence that the street network pattern affects either short or long non-work travel decisions. While results may vary in other areas, the empirical argument for using land use as an element of regional air quality or other environmental plans remains to be demonstrated.},

  abstract = {There is increased awareness of the role of the urban landscape in promoting walking to counter the negative health and wellbeing impacts of age-related immobility. Consideration of neighbourhood design is particularly relevant in the context of local urban regeneration projects, which are designed to have positive health and wellbeing outcomes. However, few studies explicitly investigate how the environment influences walking and wellbeing for older adults living in deprived urban areas. There are strong conceptual and empirical links between walking, the urban environment and mental wellbeing. Many studies have separately demonstrated pairwise associations between all three components. In this paper we address these three concepts empirically, using structural equation modelling to explore walking as a mediator between the perceived social and built environments and mental wellbeing for older adults in deprived urban areas. We found direct and indirect relationships between neighbourhood perceptions and wellbeing. Walking partially mediates relationships between social contact, neighbourhood quality, local amenity use, safety and mental wellbeing. Although neighbourhood problems and the quality of local services and amenities are associated with mental wellbeing, walking is not an explanatory pathway in our model. The relationship between walking and wellbeing is weaker than expected. While promoting walking as a means of achieving positive mental wellbeing among older adults is important for ``active ageing'', it is also necessary to consider the context in which this takes place, recognising that walking is not the only potential causal pathway between environment and wellbeing. Where walking is relied upon for transport, the wellbeing implications may be more complex. Given the strong associations between car ownership and wellbeing, future research should explore whether mobility and accessibility, rather than walking itself, is more important for older adults' wellbeing.},

To date, this movement has yet to influence U.S. federal housing policy, which has historically prioritized tax expenditures supporting homeownership over affordable rental housing subsidies for low-income households. This paper takes these appeals to housing justice seriously and asks, `What would a conception of housing justice offer to housing policy makers seeking to enact comprehensive housing policy reforms designed to shift the balance of federal housing policy priorities away from homeownership towards the satisfaction of low-income households' basic housing needs?' I propose a conception of housing justice grounded in the ideal of civic equality, apply civic equality toward the evaluation of current U.S. federal housing policy, and propose a comprehensive national housing policy reform that is consistent with civic equality. The proposed `negative housing tax' extends the idea of a negative income tax to a tax on housing consumption and capital gains from home sales. The revenues generated from the tax provide funds to support a guaranteed monthly housing allowance that would be distributed to those facing the most severe housing needs.},

After adjustment for material deprivation, travel times in England were no longer significantly associated with survival. In France patients living between 20 and 90min from the nearest cancer unit tended to have a poorer survival, although this was not statistically significant. In England, the better prognosis observed for remote patients can be explained by associations with material deprivation; distance to health services alone did not affect survival whilst material deprivation level had a major influence, with lower survival for patients living in deprived areas. Increases in travel times to health services in France were associated with poorer survival rates. The pattern of this influence seems to follow an inverse U distribution, i.e. maximal for average travel times.},

There were very clear differences in mobility and car reliance between geographic locations. Car reliance peaked in fringe Melbourne with regional areas showing slightly less car reliance. Mobility and kilometres travelled also increased with distance from central Melbourne, which in turn resulted in greater sensitivity to fuel price increases. Again these factors were greatest in fringe Melbourne. Links between transport disadvantage and social exclusion were small and inconsistent in this paper although they have been demonstrated in other research. Links between transport disadvantage and well-being were strongest in the regional sample. The implications of these findings and their connection to the transport literature are discussed.},

  abstract = {Equity has been a major concern of public transport provision and is required by legislation in many countries. Several approaches measure equity in transit supply however none produce a simple system-wide measure of equity performance. A new approach is presented using Lorenz curves to measure the relative supply of transit to the population. Gini coefficients provide a single measure of overall equity using this method. A system-wide assessment of overall transit supply to the population in Melbourne, Australia shows that 70\% of the population shares only 19\% of the supply (Gini coefficient=.68). When employment is also taken into account, the situation is not much different; 70\% of jobs and population share 23\% of service (G=.62). In order to gain some understanding of vertical equity, the transit supply was compared between different age, income and vehicle ownership groups. There is some evidence of higher supply for youth and low-income groups in inner Melbourne, and in all parts of Melbourne no-vehicle households lived in areas of higher transit supply. Overall it is unclear how ``fair'' these distributions are compared to equity in other cities since this is the first time this method has been undertaken. Projects using similar approaches should provide a good basis for establishing comparative equity between cities.},

Many cities across the world have recently launched ambitious programmes of BRT system implementation with varying success. This paper intends to provide an overview of the recent developments of BRT across the globe, and discusses the current issues and debates relating to the land development impact of BRT. It considers in turn the impact of BRT examining technical performance, cost issues and land development impact. The paper concludes that appropriately designed and operated BRT systems offer an innovative approach to providing a high-quality transport service, comparable to a rail service but at a relatively low cost and short implementation time. In common with other forms of mass transit, a full-featured BRT has the potential to offer significant effects on land development; the literature review also indicates that more work is needed to investigate this.}

Also walkability, a mode-specific type of accessibility referring to how easy it is to walk (to destinations) received increased attention in the last two decades. In recent years, a new focus has been on how people perceive their accessibility as this may be a stronger predictor of travel behaviour than objective elements of accessibility (such as built environment characteristics). Perceived walkability, i.e. how walk-friendly people experience a certain area, however, has only been explored by a limited number of studies. In this review paper, we give an overview of existing studies analysing perceived walkability, which mostly have focused on its effects on walking frequency/duration, physical activity and various aspects of mental well-being. Based on this literature review, a conceptual model is created, emphasising the determinants and effects of perceived walkability and how it is related to objective walkability. We end this paper by providing avenues for further research, including the introduction of a Short Perceived Walkability Scale (SPWS) and recommendations for data collection and analysis. Doing so can create new insights into perceived walkability and links with related elements, and therefore can contribute to stimulating walking trips and improving the experience of these trips.},

EoT differs from the commonly used (perceived) accessibility concept, which only takes into account (perceptions towards) objectively measured built environment characteristics, as it also includes personal abilities and motivations for travel. EoT may provide valuable insights in people's travel behaviour intentions and can help in creating more sustainable travel patterns, but also in stimulating better access to out-of-home activities and higher travel satisfaction levels, thereby improving people's subjective well-being. EoT may serve as a user-friendly and policy-relevant alternative of the often unclear and complex accessibility concept.},

  abstract = {Recently, there have been growing concerns about the negative impacts of rising automobile use and road congestion on personal mobility, safety, air quality and climate change. To address these issues, special attention has been given to improving and expanding transit services in order to attract new riders and retain existing ones. Despite these efforts, transit ridership across Canada has been levelling-off and, in many cases, declining over the past few years. The goal of this study is to provide an empirical investigation of variables that affect variations in transit ridership among transit systems and over time. To achieve this goal, the study used a comprehensive longitudinal dataset of different factors collected from 103 transit agencies in Canada between 2002 and 2016. Two-stage least square (2SLS) models were developed for the purpose of the study. The results suggest that transit ridership (in terms of number of linked trips) in Canada is associated with several factors that differ according to transit agency size. These factors include built environment and socioeconomic aspects in addition to transit supply attributes. Additionally, ride-sharing systems (i.e., Uber service) have a mixed impact on ridership that varies according to the size of transit system. The presence of Uber within large transit agencies service areas is shown to have a small positive impact on ridership, while it is negatively associated with ridership for small transit agencies. This paper provides policy makers and planners with useful policy-relevant information related to the association between different factors and transit ridership.},

Using a socio-technical theoretical perspective, the paper argues that suburbia should be seen a complex `assemblage' that is configured through socio-material relations of land use, transport technology, energy and money credit. This system is also differentiated by social status and infrastructure access deficits. The paper argues that suburbia faces a number of socio-technical challenges from an energy transition principally due to heavy mobility reliance on motor vehicles. The paper sets out some potential trajectories of transformation for suburbia under an energy transition.},

Yet the concept of walkability itself remains elusive \textendash{} difficult to define or operationalise. Density, functional mix and access networks are wellrecognised as key factors: density concentrates more people and places within walkable distances; functional mix produces a greater range of walkable destinations; and access networks mediate flows of traffic between them. This complex synergy of density, mix and access \textendash{} herein called the urban DMA \textendash{} largely stems from the work of Jacobs. With an approach based in assemblage thinking we show that each of these factors is multiple and problematic to define or measure. Any reduction to a singular index of morphological properties can involve a misrecognition of how cities work. We argue that walkability is a complex and somewhat nebulous set of capacities embodied in any urban morphology, and that it should not be conflated with nor derived from actual levels of walking.},

Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.},

  abstract = {The ``Healthy Immigrant Effect'' (HIE) suggests that immigrants have a health advantage over the domestic-born which vanishes with increased length of residency. Most HIE research focuses on physical health, with less attention given to mental health (MH). This systematic review of 58 MH studies examines whether there is a MH advantage among immigrants and explores changes in immigrants' MH, besides critically assessing the use of HIE theory. Inconsistent evidence was detected regarding the presence of MH advantage, whereas consistent, convincing evidence was revealed for a decline in immigrants' MH over years. Although the HIE theory can help reveal MH disparities, this theory alone does not explain the reasons for these disparities nor inform about potential avenues to improve immigrants' MH. A paradigm shift is needed to incorporate other potential theoretical concepts/frameworks, including the ``Health Inequalities Action'' framework, for a broader understanding of MH issues and to inform effective, culturally-sensitive interventions.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for causal inference in the observational social sciences. It focuses on DAGs' main uses, discusses central principles, and gives applied examples. DAGs are visual representations of qualitative causal assumptions: They encode researchers' beliefs about how the world works. Straightforward rules map these causal assumptions onto the associations and independencies in observable data. The two primary uses of DAGs are (1) determining the identifiability of causal effects from observed data and (2) deriving the testable implications of a causal model. Concepts covered in this chapter include identification, d-separation, confounding, endogenous selection, and overcontrol. Illustrative applications then demonstrate that conditioning on variables at any stage in a causal process can induce as well as remove bias, that confounding is a fundamentally causal rather than an associational concept, that conventional approaches to causal mediation analysis are often biased, and that causal inference in social networks inherently faces endogenous selection bias. The chapter discusses several graphical criteria for the identification of causal effects of single, time-point treatments (including the famous backdoor criterion), as well identification criteria for multiple, time-varying treatments.},

We also examine different components of CSC and their association with self-rated health. Finally, we look at differences in susceptibility between different socio-demographic groups. We use the cross-sectional base line study of the Stockholm Public Health Cohort, conducted in 2002. A postal questionnaire was answered by 31,182 randomly selected citizens, 18\textendash 84 years old, in Stockholm County. We used four measures of social capital: horizontal (civic trust and participation), vertical (political trust and participation), cognitive (civic and political trust) and structural (civic and political participation). CSC was measured at parish level from aggregated individual data, and multilevel regression procedures were employed. We show a twofold greater risk of poor self-rated health in areas with very low CSC compared with areas with very high CSC. Adjustments for individual socio-demographic factors, contextual economic factors and individual social capital lowered the excess risk. Simultaneous adjustment for all three forms of confounding further weakened the association and rendered it insignificant. Cognitive and structural social capital show relatively similar associations with self-rated health, while horizontal CSC seems to be more strongly related to self-rated health than vertical CSC. In conclusion, whether there is none or a moderate association between CSC and self-rated health, depends on the extent to which individual social capital is seen as a mediator or confounder. The association with self-rated health is similar independent of the measure of CSC used. It is also similar in different socio-demographic groups.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In rural settings, HIV-infected pregnant women often live significant distances from facilities that provide prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services. METHODS: We offered universal maternal combination antiretroviral regimens in 4 pilot sites in rural Zambia. To evaluate the impact of services, we conducted a household survey in communities surrounding each facility. We collected information about HIV status and antenatal service utilization from women who delivered in the past 2 years. Using household Global Positioning System coordinates collected in the survey, we measured Euclidean (i.e., straight line) distance between individual households and clinics. Multivariable logistic regression and predicted probabilities were used to determine associations between distance and uptake of PMTCT regimens. RESULTS: From March to December 2011, 390 HIV-infected mothers were surveyed across four communities. Of these, 254 (65\%) had household geographical coordinates documented. One hundred sixty-eight women reported use of a PMTCT regimen during pregnancy including 102 who initiated a combination antiretroviral regimen. The probability of PMTCT regimen initiation was the highest within 1.9 km of the facility and gradually declined. Overall, 103 of 145 (71\%) who lived within 1.9 km of the facility initiated PMTCT versus 65 of 109 (60\%) who lived farther away. For every kilometer increase, the association with PMTCT regimen uptake (adjusted odds ratio: 0.90, 95\% confidence interval: 0.82 to 0.99) and combination antiretroviral regimen uptake (adjusted odds ratio: 0.88, 95\% confidence interval: 0.80 to 0.97) decreased. CONCLUSIONS: In this rural African setting, uptake of PMTCT regimens was influenced by distance to health facility. Program models that further decentralize care into remote communities are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

  abstract = {Including all relevant material - good, bad, and indifferent - in meta -analysis admits the subjective judgments that meta-analysis was designed to avoid. Several problems arise in meta-analysis: regressions are often non -linear; effects are often multivariate rather than univariate; coverage can be restricted; bad studies may be included; the data summarised may not be homogeneous; grouping different causal factors may lead to meaningless estimates of effects; and the theory-directed approach may obscure discrepancies. Meta-analysis may not be the one best method for studying the diversity of fields for which it has been used. Why do we undertake systematic reviews of a given field? The most important reason is perhaps that we are concerned about a particular theory and wish to know how the evidence for and against stacks up. There are also practical reasons; single studies often use small numbers of subjects, and basing our estimates of effect sizes on large numbers of studies drastically lowers the fiducial limits around our estimates. Systematic reviews can be of several different kinds: traditional reviews, often not very systematic, and frequently biased; meta-analyses, including (we hope) all relevant material, good, bad, and different, and leading to an estimate of effect size*RF 1-3*; best-evidence synthesis4; and the hypothetico-deductive approach,5 in which the effort is directed at evaluating the evidence for and against a given theory, in an attempt to solve the problem of why contradictory results appear, rather than simply averaging often incompatible data. Critics may object to my statement that meta-analysis involves material good, bad, and indifferent, but consider the study by Smith et al (discussed in more detail later), which numbered among its authors the originator of the term.6 The authors complained about the subjectivity that had led previous reviewers of studies assessing the effects of psychotherapy \ldots},

Link as well as intersection stress is calculated to develop a citywide network of cycling stress. The cumulative opportunities reachable at four levels of cycling stress are calculated for each dissemination area in the city. The results show a low level of cycling access ({$<$}5000 jobs) across most of the city at low levels of stress (LTS\,{$\leq$}\,2). Only at level of stress three, where cyclists may be required to negotiate with vehicles and may be in proximity of high-speed traffic, does cycling accessibility rise above 15,000 jobs for a sizeable section of the city. The link between low-stress access to jobs and the decision to cycle from home is investigated using a binary logit model. The results indicate that the cycling accessibly measure has a significant effect on choosing cycling as the travel mode with larger effect for low-stress access. The low stress cycling accessibility to subway stations is calculated as an example of the practical applications of this method and illustrates the limited cycling access to many stations in the Toronto network. Further, a theoretical scenario analysis is undertaken comparing different bicycle network scenarios. Three scenarios are tested 1) removing all cycle tracks, 2) upgrading all bike lanes to cycle tracks, and 3) decreasing street speeds by 10\,km/h on the road network entire network. Scenario 3 in particular drastically increases cycling access to jobs.},

Yet over the past three decades the ideological triumph of neoliberalism has caused the allocation of spatial, political, economic, and financial resources to favor economic growth at the expense of wider social benefits. Susan Fainstein's concept of the "just city" encourages planners and policymakers to embrace a different approach to urban development. Her objective is to combine progressive city planners' earlier focus on equity and material well-being with considerations of diversity and participation so as to foster a better quality of urban life within the context of a global capitalist political economy. Fainstein applies theoretical concepts about justice developed by contemporary philosophers to the concrete problems faced by urban planners and policymakers and argues that, despite structural obstacles, meaningful reform can be achieved at the local level.   In the first half of  \emph{The Just City} , Fainstein draws on the work of John Rawls, Martha Nussbaum, Iris Marion Young, Nancy Fraser, and others to develop an approach to justice relevant to twenty-first-century cities, one that incorporates three central concepts: diversity, democracy, and equity. In the book's second half, Fainstein tests her ideas through case studies of New York, London, and Amsterdam by evaluating their postwar programs for housing and development in relation to the three norms. She concludes by identifying a set of specific criteria for urban planners and policymakers to consider when developing programs to assure greater justice in both the process of their formulation and their effects.

In the first half of \emph{The Just City} , Fainstein draws on the work of John Rawls, Martha Nussbaum, Iris Marion Young, Nancy Fraser, and others to develop an approach to justice relevant to twenty-first-century cities, one that incorporates three central concepts: diversity, democracy, and equity. In the book's second half, Fainstein tests her ideas through case studies of New York, London, and Amsterdam by evaluating their postwar programs for housing and development in relation to the three norms. She concludes by identifying a set of specific criteria for urban planners and policymakers to consider when developing programs to assure greater justice in both the process of their formulation and their effects.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to develop and apply a new method for assessing social equity impacts of distance-based public transit fares. Shifting to a distance-based fare structure can disproportionately favor or penalize different subgroups of a population based on variations in settlement patterns, travel needs, and most importantly, transit use. According to federal law, such disparities must be evaluated by the transit agency, but the area-based techniques identified by the Federal Transit Authority for assessing discrimination fail to account for disparities in distances travelled by transit users. This means that transit agencies currently lack guidelines for assessing the social equity impacts of replacing flat fare with distance-based fare structures. Our solution is to incorporate a joint ordinal/continuous model of trip generation and distance travelled into a GIS Decision Support System. The system enables a transit planner to visualize and compare distance travelled and transit-cost maps for different population profiles and fare structures. We apply the method to a case study in the Wasatch Front, Utah, where the Utah Transit Authority is exploring a switch to a distance-based fare structure. The analysis reveals that overall distance-based fares benefit low-income, elderly, and non-white populations. However, the effect is geographically uneven, and may be negative for members of these groups living on the urban fringe.},

  abstract = {Food desert studies attempt to identify geographic areas in which people lack access to sources of healthy food. While academic and policy research often defines access to food stores using simple Euclidean distance or road network metrics, dense urban areas with large public transit systems call for more sophisticated methods of determining access. It is particularly important to understand the level of access the transit-dependent population has to healthy food vendors, as their mobility is largely constrained by the routes and scheduling of their local public transportation system. In this study, we analyze public transit access to supermarkets in Cincinnati, Ohio. Using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data from the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) and the Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (TANK) and custom ArcGIS tools, we calculate the time it takes to travel from each Cincinnati census block to its nearest supermarkets at different times of the day. This transit-travel-time matrix allows us to investigate food deserts that change shape based on the time of day considered and to calculate the temporal variability in block-level access. Also, by combining this time-dependent analysis with census data on race, income, and age, we search for disparities in average levels of accessibility. The results of this analysis identify the areas and subpopulations in Cincinnati with the greatest need for improved access to healthy food stores and will demonstrate how schedule-dependent transportation can be factored into measures of accessibility. Ultimately, this study paints a more complete and realistic picture of food deserts in Cincinnati and helps policy-makers better target interventions aimed at mitigating their effects.},

Providing a historic perspective on the standards and regulations that got us to where we are today in terms of urban lifestyle and attempts at reform, Douglas Farr makes a powerful case for sustainable urbanism, showing where we went wrong, and where we need to go. He then explains how to implement sustainable urbanism through leadership and communication in cities, communities, and neighborhoods. Essays written by Farr and others delve into such issues as: Increasing sustainability through density. Integrating transportation and land use. Creating sustainable neighborhoods, including housing, car-free areas, locally-owned stores, walkable neighborhoods, and universal accessibility. The health and environmental benefits of linking humans to nature, including walk-to open spaces, neighborhood stormwater systems and waste treatment, and food production. High performance buildings and district energy systems. Enriching the argument are in-depth case studies in sustainable urbanism, from BedZED in London, England and Newington in Sydney, Australia, to New Railroad Square in Santa Rosa, California and Dongtan, Shanghai, China. An epilogue looks to the future of sustainable urbanism over the next 200 years. At once solidly researched and passionately argued, Sustainable Urbanism is the ideal guidebook for urban designers, planners, and architects who are eager to make a positive impact on our--and our descendants'--buildings, cities, and lives.},

Since then, the ``Bradford Hill Criteria'' have become the most frequently cited framework for causal inference in epidemiologic studies. However, when Hill published his causal guidelines\textemdash just 12~years after the double-helix model for DNA was first suggested and 25~years before the Human Genome Project began\textemdash disease causation was understood on a more elementary level than it is today. Advancements in genetics, molecular biology, toxicology, exposure science, and statistics have increased our analytical capabilities for exploring potential cause-and-effect relationships, and have resulted in a greater understanding of the complexity behind human disease onset and progression. These additional tools for causal inference necessitate a re-evaluation of how each Bradford Hill criterion should be interpreted when considering a variety of data types beyond classic epidemiology studies. Herein, we explore the implications of data integration on the interpretation and application of the criteria. Using examples of recently discovered exposure\textendash response associations in human disease, we discuss novel ways by which researchers can apply and interpret the Bradford Hill criteria when considering data gathered using modern molecular techniques, such as epigenetics, biomarkers, mechanistic toxicology, and genotoxicology.},

On this basis it is suggested that the conventional environmental equity analysis, whereby the affected areas are compared to unaffected areas, is unlikely to render robust or meaningful results. Rather, the focus of research should be on the equity implications of policies geared to mitigate transport systems' environmental externalities, and on comparisons of users of the different transportation systems to those exposed to the negative environmental externalities of these systems. The results of such studies could provide direct inputs into comprehensive balanced policy packages within a sustainable transport strategy.},

The overarching purpose is to improve access via transit to basic amenities to: (1) reduce the disproportionate burden faced by transit dependent populations; and (2) create a more feasible transportation option for low-income households as an opportunity to increase financial security by reducing dependence on personal autos. The formulation is applied to data from a mid-sized US metropolitan area. The example application illustrates the formulation successfully increases access to employment opportunities for residents in areas with high percentages of low-income persons, as well as demonstrates the importance of considering uncertainty in the locations of populations and employment.},

The low-density functional specialization and all-out automobile orientation of this new urban form were ideally suited to the circumstances of the time, thus accounting for its rapid adoption. DS also proved to be adaptable to changing societal circumstances, which explains its predominance as an urban development model under both Fordism and neoliberalism. The adaptability of this urban form also contributed to its spread across much of the world, including Europe. This essay contends that powerful path dependencies maintain DS in place, despite planning efforts to achieve more compact, public-transit oriented urban development. It also argues that the persistence of DS is a source of hardship for low-income households forced to live in suburban environments, and entrenches conservative political values.},

Our purpose in making this comparison is to consider how scholars concerned with justice and injustice in the city might better articulate the conceptual relationship between justice-thinking and (in)justice-documenting in their writings about the contemporary planned city. Using a selection of influential texts as evidence, our comparative commentary on past and present approaches focuses on three issues we think are crucial to this relationship. First, with the rise of analyses of the politics of difference, concepts of justice stressing procedure, process, and the hearing of multiple voices have come to the fore recently, especially in urban planning. Second, contemporary writers about geographies of justice have queried the value of using pre-formulated, philosophical justice norms to judge outcomes and processes in particular contexts, seeing justice, rather, as intuited in the enactment of social conflicts and practices in those actual situations. Third, questions about the spatiality of justice and injustice have been aired recently asking whether justice and injustice have primarily a social rather than a spatial ontology. The conclusion of our evaluative review is that similar issues are being named and investigated now as were four decades ago, in investigations of justice and injustice in cities, but that concerted debates about theory and epistemology have elaborated the conceptual focus of discussion. We call for grounded investigations of enactments of justice as well as of injustice.},

The modifiable areal unit problem is shown to be essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis and is therefore a much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis. The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units.

  abstract = {Economic factors have an impact on how the built environment is shaped, which in turn affects how we choose to travel. Regional transportation investment decisions are firmly rooted in economic ``cost\textendash benefit'' trade-off considerations. The placement (central or outlying) and mode of transportation in which investments are made (transit, highway, sidewalks, or bikeways) influence where homes, businesses, schools, and other types of uses are located. Transportation investments create or limit access and establish a set of economic trade-offs that help determine if an area will be compact or dispersed, and mixed use or single use. Developers consider cost trade-offs between constructing connected street grids versus disconnected cul-de-sac networks, which determines if residents can walk to services and transit. Taken collectively, transportation investments and resulting land-use patterns determine if destinations are far apart or close together and linked with direct and safe sidewalks or bikeways. The end result is a built environment that determines whether walking and biking is feasible or perceived as more beneficial than driving or taking transit. This paper assesses (1) the economic forces that shape transportation investment decisions, (2) the economic impact of these investments on land use, and (3) how we as consumers choose to travel as a result of these transportation investment and land-use decisions.},

  abstract = {One of the concerns that has aroused much scholarly attention in transport geography lately is the extent to which public transport provision enables the less privileged population segments, especially those without privately owned motorized vehicles, to participate in activities that are deemed normal within the society they live in. This study contributes to this line of inquiry by proposing a methodology for identifying public transit gaps, a mismatch between the socially driven demand for transit and the supply provided by transit agencies. The methodology draws on the latest accomplishments in the field of modeling time-continuous, schedule-based public transport accessibility. Accessibility levels to key destinations are calculated at regular time intervals, and synoptic metrics of these levels over various peak and off-peak time windows are computed for weekdays and weekends. As a result, a temporally reliable picture of accessibility by public transport is constructed. The obtained index of public transport provision is compared to a public transport needs index based on the spatial distribution of various socio-demographics, in order to highlight spatial mismatches between these two indices. The study area consists of Flanders, which is the northern, Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. The results indicate that mainly suburban areas are characterized by high public transport gaps. Due to the time-variability of public transport frequencies, these gaps differ over time.},

  abstract = {In the course of the last thirty years, feminist theories of gender have shifted from quasi-Marxist, labor-centered conceptions to putatively ``post-Marxist''culture- and identity-based conceptions. Reflecting a broader political move from redistribution to recognition, this shift has been double-edged. On the one hand, it has broadened feminist politics to encompass legitimate issues of representation, identity, and difference. Yet, in the context of an ascendant neoliberalism, feminist struggles for recognition may be serving to less to enrich struggles for redistribution than to displace the latter. I aim to resist that trend. In this essay, I propose an analysis of gender that is broad enough to house the full range of feminist concerns, those central to the old socialist-feminism as well as those rooted in the cultural turn. I also propose a correspondingly broad conception of justice, capable of encompassing both distribution and recognition, and a non-identitarian account of recognition, capable of synergizing with redistribution. I conclude by examining some practical problems that arise when we try to envision institutional reforms that could redress gender maldistribution and gender misrecognition simultaneously.},

Such models can overfit, leading to causal inferences that are substantively implausible and that arbitrarily attribute variation to the high-degree polynomial or the discontinuity. This paper examines two recent studies that make use of regression discontinuity to discuss evident practical problems with these estimates and how they interact with pathologies of the current system of scientific publication. First, we discuss a recent study that estimates the effect on air pollution and life expectancy of a coal-heating policy in China. The reported effects, based on a third-degree polynomial, are statistically significant but substantively dubious, and are sensitive to model choice. This study is indicative of a category of policy analyses where strong claims are based on weak data and methodologies which permit the researcher wide latitude in presenting estimated treatment effects. We then replicate a procedure from Green et al., in which regression discontinuity is used to recover estimated treatment effects relative to an experimental benchmark, to illustrate one practical problem with the regression discontinuity estimates in the coal-heating paper: high-degree polynomials yield noisy estimates of treatment effects that do not accurately convey uncertainty. We recommend that (a) researchers consider the problems which may result from controlling for higher-order polynomials; and (b) that journals recognize that quantitative analyses of policy issues are often inconclusive and relax the implicit rule under which statistical significance is a condition for publication.},

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial\textendash temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.},

It requires a more complete understanding of accessibility than traditional indicators offer, and also depends on the theory of justice used.},

  abstract = {Introduction Transportation is an integral part of our daily lives, giving us access to people, education, jobs, services, and goods. Our transportation choices and patterns are influenced by four interrelated factors: the land use and built environment, infrastructure, available modes, and emerging technologies/disruptors. These factors influence how we can or choose to move ourselves and goods. In turn, these factors impact various exposures, lifestyles and health outcomes. Aim and methods We developed a conceptual model to clarify the connections between transportation and health. We conducted a literature review focusing on publications from the past seven years. We complemented this with expert knowledge and synthesized information to summarize the health outcomes of transportation, along 14 identified pathways. Results The pathways linking transportation to health include those that are beneficial, such as when transportation serves as means for social connectivity, independence, physical activity, and access. Some pathways link transportation to detrimental health outcomes from air pollution, road travel injuries, noise, stress, urban heat islands, contamination, climate change, community severance, and restricted green space, blue space, and aesthetics. Other possible effects may come from electromagnetic fields, but this is not definitive. We define each pathway and summarize its health outcomes. We show that transportation-related exposures and associated health outcomes, and their severity, can be influenced by inequity and intrinsic and extrinsic effect modifiers. Conclusions While some pathways are widely discussed in the literature, others are new or under-researched. Our conceptual model can form the basis for future studies looking to explore the transportation-health nexus. We also propose the model as a tool to holistically assess the impact of transportation decisions on public health.},

  abstract = {Introduction Transportation is an integral part of our daily lives, giving us access to people, education, jobs, services, and goods. Our transportation choices and patterns are influenced by four interrelated factors: the land use and built environment, infrastructure, available modes, and emerging technologies/disruptors. These factors influence how we can or choose to move ourselves and goods. In turn, these factors impact various exposures, lifestyles and health outcomes. Aim and methods We developed a conceptual model to clarify the connections between transportation and health. We conducted a literature review focusing on publications from the past seven years. We complemented this with expert knowledge and synthesized information to summarize the health outcomes of transportation, along 14 identified pathways. Results The pathways linking transportation to health include those that are beneficial, such as when transportation serves as means for social connectivity, independence, physical activity, and access. Some pathways link transportation to detrimental health outcomes from air pollution, road travel injuries, noise, stress, urban heat islands, contamination, climate change, community severance, and restricted green space, blue space, and aesthetics. Other possible effects may come from electromagnetic fields, but this is not definitive. We define each pathway and summarize its health outcomes. We show that transportation-related exposures and associated health outcomes, and their severity, can be influenced by inequity and intrinsic and extrinsic effect modifiers. Conclusions While some pathways are widely discussed in the literature, others are new or under-researched. Our conceptual model can form the basis for future studies looking to explore the transportation-health nexus. We also propose the model as a tool to holistically assess the impact of transportation decisions on public health.},

While the provision of transport and the development of transport policy involve both the public and private sectors, it is typically governments (at all levels) that establish and coordinate transport policies for their jurisdictions. Transport systems are vital to societal and economic development, and, because of the scale, speed, and complexity of contemporary transport, transport policies related to economic competitiveness, technology, environmental impacts, safety, and security have become increasingly important. Starting in the late 1970s, transport policies worldwide have emphasized more private sector participation through deregulation, liberalization, and privatization initiatives in the airline, maritime, railroad, and trucking industries, as well as in infrastructure provision. Because transport is a major consumer of petroleum and a contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, transport policy since the 1990s has become more focused on sustainability. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have focused greater attention on transport security policies.},

One objective of the research reported here is to test for such temporal biases in a seven-day travel diary. A second objective is to calculate correction factors which can be applied to the data in the case that biases are found. The analyses were conducted using regression and analysis-of-variance techniques. The variables investigated included total trips per day, total travel time per day, and trips per day by various modes (such as walking, car driver and car passenger). Results showed that most biases per capita statistics are due to increases over time in the percentage of respondents reporting no travel at all for an entire day. However, even after accounting for this bias by measuring statistics in terms of ``per mobile person'', there remains a decrease over time of about 3.5 percent per day in the reporting of walking trips. This appears to be the main factor in the overall bias of about one percent per day in total trips per mobile person per day. No significant differences were found among population segments in terms of the levels of their biases.},

While the benefits of a metropolitan decentralization of jobs, housing, and public investment fell to Whites, discrimination in employment and housing trapped African Americans in urban neighborhoods burdened by infrastructure encroachment and divestment. By circa 1970, overt discrimination succumbed to new, racially neutral, legal, and administrative forms, including regional planning processes. Using an environmental racism framework, we show that these new forms reproduced the existing racialized geography by means of new inequalities in representation and transportation service provision. These new regional transportation policies, like those challenged by a 2005 civil rights lawsuit, favored the mobility needs of more affluent suburbanites over those of African American East Bay bus riders. These policies, layered onto an existing racialized geography, reinforced existing inequalities by failing to address racial barriers to opportunity in the built environment.

As a result, dysfunctions in concession contracts based essentially on fare revenue linked to the number of paying users became evident. In this article, we will analyze case studies of the adoption of free fare or social fare that break the vicious cycle of transport, a combination of precariousness and a tariff increase to respond to the reduction of passengers, reproducing itself until its bankruptcy. These new models are based on the principle of transportation as a social right, constitutionally recognized since 2015, but far from being a reality in Brazilian cities. As a result, these cities escape the precariousness of public transport and show that there are alternative ways to provide access to the city for everyone.},

If true, it would provide a useful touchstone to test the reliability of existing transport models and a constraint to improve them. This paper has five parts. First, a number of ways are investigated in which a known travel budget could be incorporated into the generation, mode choice or distribution parts of current models. Secondly, there is a discussion of some implications of doing this on policy evaluation. Thirdly consideration is given to some of the difficulties in interpreting empirical work on this subject, to judge whether inferences that have been drawn on stability of travel budgets are supported. Fourthly, some theoretical problems are raised, particularly relating to the behavioral implications of stable budget assumptions. Lastly, some general conclusions are drawn. It is suggested that we are likely to learn most about travel behaviour, mobility and the effect of alternative policies if the time and money allocated to travel are treated as variables, not behavioral constants. These outlays are likely to be influenced, in particular, by travel opportunities and costs, as well as various socio-economic and personal characteristics.},

Initiatives such as the ``15-minutes city'' have been put in place to shift the attention from monocentric city configurations to polycentric structures, increasing the availability and diversity of local urban amenities. Ultimately they expect to increase local walkability and increase mobility within residential areas. While we know how urban amenities influence human mobility at the city level, little is known about spatial variations in this relationship. Here, we use mobile phone, census, and volunteered geographical data to measure geographic variations in the relationship between origin-destination flows and local urban accessibility in Barcelona. Using a Negative Binomial Geographically Weighted Regression model, we show that, globally, people tend to visit neighborhoods with better access to education and retail. Locally, these and other features change in sign and magnitude through the different neighborhoods of the city in ways that are not explained by administrative boundaries, and that provide deeper insights regarding urban characteristics such as rental prices. In conclusion, our work suggests that the qualities of a 15-minutes city can be measured at scale, delivering actionable insights on the polycentric structure of cities, and how people use and access this structure.},

Abstract With the aim of creating more efficient and attractive communities, Canadian planning policy since the 1970s has been advocating compact form, mixed-use, higher densities, and a range of housing to suit divergent household needs. This paper examines contemporary planning practice in rapidly growing cities in three provinces to explore how policy texts and practitioner discourses construct the relationship between housing types and household needs. While planning policies advocate "complete communities," planning and development practice encounters and reproduces suburban aspirations for conventional homeownership: the Canadian dream of the detached house. In the context of rapidly increasing housing costs in some communities, those producing new suburban developments are seeking to rewrite expectations about the relationship between housing type, household stage, and urban living. Rather than a residential environment committing people to place, housing is socially constructed as a consumer good to be replaced as households reach (re)productive milestones.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so\textemdash and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

Other common criticisms are that P-values force users to focus on irrelevant hypotheses and overstate evidence against those hypotheses. These problems are not however properties of P-values but are faults of researchers who focus on null hypotheses and overstate evidence based on misperceptions that p\,=\,0.05 represents enough evidence to reject hypotheses. Those problems are easily seen without use of Bayesian concepts by translating the observed P-value p into the Shannon information (S-value or surprisal) \textendash log2(p).},

  abstract = {Emerging transportation technologies (e.g., electric vehicles) and services (e.g., shared mobility) provide efficient, sustainable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional travel modes. However, whether these innovative technologies bring benefits to different population groups in an equal and reasonable manner is still an open question. The various methods applied to evaluate the equity performance of these systems are also not clearly comparable. In this paper, we comprehensively review methods from the existing literature for assessing the equity of a few important system outcomes: accessibility, traffic emissions, and safety. We also identify the existing challenges of analyzing equity for emerging transportation technologies. We unify the existing methodologies into a three-step framework that includes population measurement, cost/benefit measurement and equity assessment, and we summarize the applicable measurements for each step, in detail. A handful of literature focusing on emerging transportation technologies, such as shared mobility and autonomous vehicles, were also identified and surveyed; the methodologies used were found to fit with the three-step framework. We summarize the major findings and discuss promising directions for developing more sophisticated equity assessment methodologies for emerging transportation technologies. Overall, based on a comprehensive review, this paper contributes a framework for assessing the equity of transportation systems that integrates accessibility, traffic emissions, and safety outcomes. The summarized framework can be an overview resource to assist researchers and transportation planners who require equity analysis methods. The research gaps identified also provide directions for equity research on emerging transportation technologies.},

We estimated a hybrid discrete choice model for the new cable car service considering social capital as a latent variable and a stated preference survey issued before the cable car implementation. Social capital is measured through six domains associated with membership of civic groups, social networks, interpersonal trust, institutional trust, cooperation, and empowerment. Results suggest that the social capital stock in the influence zone of the cable car depends principally on age, sex, education level, and time living in the neighborhood. Results also show that higher social capital stocks are associated with a greater willingness to use the new cable car service, suggesting that social capital is a potential determinant for mode choice. Finally, we discuss implications for social capital and policymaking.},

  abstract = {The BMI is the best available tool for monitoring progress in the campaign against obesity The House of Commons Select Committee on obesity, and two expert groups in the USA, recommend that the body mass index (BMI) of every school child should be measured each year and the result sent home to the parents. The BMI correlates sufficiently well with direct measures of total body fat to support its use, on an anonymous basis, as a public health tool for monitoring progress in dealing with the obesity epidemic. However, the BMI is an imperfect proxy for obesity because there is much individual variability in the relationship between BMI and body fat, cardiovascular risk factors, and long term health outcomes. Whatever BMI cut offs are selected for determining the advice to parents, a high BMI calls for further evaluation and interpretation and the policy proposed by the Select Committee, to send BMI results to parents, is therefore in effect a screening programme. As such, it presents a number of difficulties and should be implemented only as a research study and not as public policy. The worldwide epidemic of childhood obesity is a public health problem for two reasons. First, it is associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Second, it is perceived in the Western world as unattractive and for many individuals it is, therefore, the cause of much unhappiness. The UK Government has set a target of ``halting the rise'' in childhood obesity by 2010.1 Concerns about obesity have generated much interest in the body mass index (BMI) as a convenient indicator of body fat and the House of Commons Select Committee on Health2 recommended that: \ldots{} throughout their time at school, children should have their Body Mass Index measured \ldots},

Methods The pooled data (n\,=\,31\,519) were extracted from a population-based survey Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool-2 (Urban HEART-2) conducted in Tehran in 2011. Mental health, social capital, and HRQoL were assessed using the 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), social capital questionnaire, and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), respectively. The study used a multistage sampling method. Social capital, HRQoL, and SES were considered as latent variables. The association between these latent variables, demographic factors, and mental health was determined by structural-equation modeling (SEM). Results The mean age and mental health score were 44.48\,{$\pm$}\,15.87 years and 23.33\,{$\pm$}\,11.10 (range, 0-84), respectively. The prevalence of mental disorders was 41.76\% (95\% confidence interval 41.21-42.30). The SEM model showed that age was directly associated with social capital (P\,=\,0.016) and mental health (P\,=\,0.001). Sex was indirectly related to mental health through social capital (P\,=\,0.018). SES, HRQoL, and social capital were associated both directly and indirectly with mental health status. Conclusion This study suggests that changes in social capital and SES can lead to positive changes in mental health status and that individual and contextual determinants influence HRQoL and mental health.},

An increasing number of nations are asking the question\textemdash what type of public transport system can deliver value for money? Although light rail has often been promoted as a popular `solution', there has been progressively emerging an attractive alternative in the form of bus rapid transit (BRT). BRT is a system operating on its own right-of-way either as a full BRT with high quality interchanges, integrated smart card fare payment and efficient throughput of passengers alighting and boarding at bus stations; or as a system with some amount of dedicated right-of-way (light BRT) and lesser integration of service and fares. The notion that buses essentially operate in a constrained service environment under a mixed traffic regime and that trains have privileged dedicated right-of-way, is no longer the only sustainable and valid proposition. This paper evaluates the status of 44 BRT systems in operation throughout the world as a way of identifying the capability of moving substantial numbers of passengers, using infrastructure whose costs overall and per kilometre are extremely attractive. When ongoing lifecycle costs (operations and maintenance) are taken into account, the costs of providing high capacity integrated BRT systems are an attractive option in many contexts.},

  abstract = {In the rapidly urbanising Southeast Asian metropolitan cities, access to key socio-economic functions such as jobs, education, and healthcare are disproportionately distributed across income groups and gender. In regions where walking is associated with low socio-economic status, those without or have restricted access to private motorised vehicles (i.e. captive pedestrians) are marginalised in a car-oriented society. Differences in the ability and capacity to move is referred to as mobility inequality. In the context of daily travel activities, the lack of ability or difficulties in performing daily mobility can exacerbate a lack of access to socio-economic opportunities. For understanding mobility inequality, socio-spatial insights can provide insights as people conform to certain social values and exhibit particular spatial tendencies while travelling, as manifested in their travel pattern and behaviours.The main objective of this dissertation is to provide socio-spatial insights into mobility inequality by investigating empirical cases in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur as typical representation of Southeast Asian metropolitan cities. A mixed method approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods is employed to unpack both the social and spatial dimension related to mobility. Findings from this dissertation confirm how mobility inequality is manifested in daily travel activities. Social practices and spatial configurations influence this manifestation in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur in the form of marginalisation of pedestrians, especially female and captive pedestrians, and private vehicle dependence. This condition occurs at both the metropolitan and the neighbourhood scales, but the mechanism of socio-spatial interplay differs across various culture and geographical contexts.},

  abstract = {The land value uplift effects of rapid transit infrastructure provide evidence of willingness to pay for more sustainable forms of development and suggest a rationale for land value capture. The present research utilizes spatio-temporal methods in a quasi-experimental research design to examine changes in property values associated with pedestrian accessibility to the West Island Line heavy rail extension in Hong Kong. Several innovations in methods and techniques are proposed that respond to the econometric challenges involved in conducting research in high density, topographically-rich cities. Of these, the paper incorporates landscape topography throughout its estimation process, including the calculation of slope-aware measures of walkable accessibility on a 3D pedestrian network and proposes a new Spherical Distance Weights method for capturing horizontal and vertical spatial association among observations in 3D space. Finally, these weights are combined with measures of temporal distance for a 4D approach that accounts for relations among observations in space and time. Spatio-temporal difference-in-differences results reveal a significant change in the value of pedestrian access to the new transit stations of between 26\% and 41\% after opening. Interestingly, uplift occurred across both the new stations as well as for properties around the previous terminus, highlighting the network effects associated with changes in accessibility. Beyond demonstrating that rail transit is valued, these findings confirm the assumptions behind the city's Rail\,+\,Property value capture approach, suggesting it remains a viable model for sustainable finance and urbanism in other high-density and transit-oriented cities.},

  abstract = {The economies of scale and network effects from agglomeration form the foundation of the economic geography of cities. These agglomerations can be associated with transportation accessibility benefits and negative externalities from increased levels of harmful emissions, both of which are impacted by congestion. Such factors imply a tension between the economies and diseconomies of agglomeration in cities. This research employs real estate transaction data to examine whether spatial trade-offs occur between the benefits and negative impacts of agglomeration in the single-detached property market around two highways in Hamilton, Canada. Our novel disaggregate approach operationalizes agglomeration using empirical estimates of accessibility to employment with calibrated impedance functions; micro-scale dispersion modelling of harmful emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5); and congestion effects in each. Descriptive analyses reveal areas of transport advantage and environmental disadvantage and cross-sectional spatio-temporal hedonic models find evidence of an agglomeration trade-off in the study area. Results suggest that households value high levels of accessibility in locations that do not experience the corresponding environmental costs from traffic. In contrast, for locations with high access and high exposure, the access benefits of agglomeration are offset by environmental costs. This approach can be used to examine the dynamics of locational advantage, spatial justice, and how trade-offs between the economies and diseconomies of urban agglomeration inform the urban spatial structure of cities.},

This research reviews the state-of-the-art in applied transportation accessibility measurement and performs a comparative evaluation of software tools for calculating accessibility by walking and public transit including ArcGIS Pro, Emme, R5R, and OpenTripPlanner using R and Python, among others. Using a case study of Toronto, we specify both origin-based and regional-scale analysis scenarios and find significant differences in computation time and calculated accessibilities. While the calculated travel time matrices are highly correlated across tools, each tool produces different results for the same origin-destination pair. Comparisons of the estimated accessibilities also reveal evidence of spatial clustering in the ways paths are calculated by some tools relative to others at different locations around the city. With the growing emphasis on accessibility-based planning, analysts should approach the calculation of accessibility with care and recognize the potential for algorithmic dependence in their calculated accessibility results.},

  abstract = {Rapid transit projects that increase accessibility should result in a localised land value uplift (LVU) benefit for locations near stations. A rich history of research has tested this hypothesis, generally operationalising transit accessibility by proxy through distance from a transit station. However, a growing body of research has also demonstrated LVU effects from transit-oriented development (TOD) as individuals sort themselves into locations that best match their preferences and willingness to pay. Considering the interdependence of transportation and land use in the urban system, we argue that these benefits create a spatial bundle of TOD goods around transit stations and hypothesise that households are willing to pay a premium for locations in more transit-oriented station catchment areas. Utilising latent class analysis, we quantify station area TOD submarkets. Next, interactions between these submarkets and station proximity in spatial hedonic regressions reveal that TOD is capitalised into land values in Toronto, though the maximum amount and spatial impact area of this capitalisation differs by TOD context.}

ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Individual records for Toronto residents aged 12 or older who responded to the 1996/97 NPHS were augmented with aggregated data from the 1996 Census to provide information on the average socio-economic characteristics of the respondents' neighbourhoods. Hierarchical linear models were used to estimate the effect of low income and income inequality at the neighbourhood level on selected health outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: When individual low-income status and several other individual characteristics were taken into account, the neighbourhood low-income rate and income inequality were not associated with individuals' reported number of chronic conditions or distress. However, both low income and income inequality at the neighbourhood level remained significantly associated with poor self-perceived health.},

The book led directly to two experiments in town-founding that by imitation, and imitation of imitation, have had a profound influence on practical urban development throughout the world. The book was responsible for the introduction of the term Garden City in numbers of languages - Cite-Jardin, Gartenstadt, Ciudad-jardin, Tuinstad - and set into motion ideas that have helped transform the scientific and political outlook on town structure and town growth. With urban renewal and the development of suburban communities as features of the contemoprary American scene, Garden cities of To-Morrow becomes "must" reading.

Using a sample of 9783 university students from Toronto, Canada, we assessed how self-reported preferences for a walkable neighborhood predicted their exposure to other walkable, non-residential environments, and further whether these preferences confounded observed walkability-physical activity associations. We found that residential walkability preferences and non-residential walkability were significant associated ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.42, 95\% CI: (0.37, 0.47)), and further that these preferences confounded associations between non-residential walkability exposure and time spent walking (reduction in association = 10.5\%).

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the distance between  residences of women diagnosed with breast cancer and the nearest mammography  facility, as a risk factor for advanced stage diagnosis in rural populations.  METHODS: 1999-2003 Kentucky Cancer Registry data were used for this study. A total  of 12,322 women, aged 40 and older at diagnosis, with no previous history of cancer,  and with known cancer stage were included. Travel distance was obtained using a  geographic information system (GIS). Hierarchical logistic regression models were  used to analyze the relationship between travel distance and advanced stage  diagnosis. RESULTS: Advanced diagnoses had longer average travel distances than  early stage diagnoses (P {$<$} 0.01). After adjusting for age, race, insurance, and  education at census tract level, the odds of advanced diagnosis were significantly  greater for women residing over 15 miles from a facility, compared to those living  within 5 miles (adjusted OR = 1.50, 95\% CI = 1.25-1.80). CONCLUSION: Although  socioeconomic status, race, and age may help explain advanced diagnoses, longer  travel distance also adversely affects early detection for rural populations.  Accurate measurement of spatial accessibility indicators, such as travel distance,  facilitates identification of at-risk groups so that interventions can be developed  to reduce this disease.},

  abstract = {Kain's Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis (SMH) suggests that disadvantaged groups who reside in inner-city neighborhoods have low access to regional jobs. This study continues to debate this assertion because empirical studies over decades have conflicting results. It examines whether the poor face spatial mismatch and how suburbanization has changed their job accessibility, in the Los Angeles region between 1990 and 2007-2011. It defines spatial mismatch as occurring when the poor in the inner city have lower job accessibility than their suburban counterparts. It estimates job accessibility based on the spatial distribution of jobs and job seekers traveling via private automobiles. The results present a complicated picture: Inner-city poor job seekers have higher job accessibility than their suburban counterparts because many jobs remain in the inner city; thus, the inner-city poor do not face spatial mismatch. Moreover, suburbanization has evened out the differences in the job accessibility of the poor and non-poor. However, the advantage of living in the inner city for job access declines with rapid employment suburbanization. This research suggests that, since the poor do not face spatial mismatch, spatial policies commonly advocated to address their employment challenges -- moving people to the suburbs, bringing jobs to the inner city, or providing mobility options -- will not be effective. Giving people cars can help overcome both spatial and nonspatial barriers, but is not politically feasible. Planners should develop synergetic policies to complement spatial approaches including reducing labor and housing market discrimination, providing education and training, developing better job search skills, and creating supportive social connections.},

It gives people a hypothetical choice between teleporting or spending some time traveling. All studies (using different methods, including focus groups, interviews, and questionnaires) have consistently reported high teleportation preferences (about 70\%). Yet, few correlates of teleportation preferences (especially sociodemographic and perceptual characteristics) have been investigated. Using data from an online questionnaire of 648 commuters in Portland, Oregon, this study investigated factors affecting individuals' teleportation preferences. While generally representative of the area's commuters, the sample did have higher shares of high-income workers and people using active modes or transit. Overall, 62\% of respondents preferred to teleport than to spend some time commuting. Results from binary logit models identified actual commute duration, typical mode of travel, and ``ideal'' travel time (but no demographic attributes) as major predictors of preferences to teleport. As expected, people with longer commute durations had a greater desire to teleport, whereas bicyclists and pedestrians more often preferred to commute. People with longer ideal travel times had a greater affinity to commute and were less keen to teleport. Analysis of follow-up questions exploring reasons for respondents' answers suggested that most ``teleporters'' were motivated by saving time to do other things, while most ``commuters'' found parts of their commutes to be enjoyable or productive. Findings from this study are consistent with related studies in implying that a teleportation preference does not necessarily represent zero ideal travel time or viewing travel time as wasted. Finally, this study discusses several travel behavior policy implications of the teleportation test, along with limitations and areas for future research.},

For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates; data availability is often limited to nonrandom, selection-biased samples; causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance; and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful and flexible causal inference framework is required in order to tackle all of these challenges, which plague essentially any data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural perspective on causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic approach proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence (AI) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal inference that allow us to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we review recent advances made in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three broad dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal learning, in which the above-mentioned problems can be addressed in generality. Second, due to their origin in AI, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete (to be formally defined) algorithmic criteria for automation of the corresponding identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the analytical rigor of structural econometrics with the flexibility of the potential outcomes framework, and thus offer a valuable complement to these two literature streams.},

Utilitarian justifications of siting decisions are inadequate because they fail to address questions of fairness. Approaches that consider questions of distributive equity provide a better framework for siting justice, but are still incomplete. Limiting questions of justice to the distribution of benefits and burdens fails to examine the justice of procedures for deciding such issues of distribution. We argue that justice requires a participatory communicative democratic process for siting hazardous facilities, in two respects. It is prima facie unjust to impose a risk on citizens without their having participated in the siting process. Participatory communicative democratic procedures in facility siting, moreover, when structured according to specific norms of discussion and inclusion, are likely to yield the most just outcomes. We propose procedural as well as substantive conditions for such democratic procedures, and briefly apply these conditions to evaluate the siting of a landfill in Switzerland.},

The objectives of this study are to examine the role of community-belonging and contextual factors on health-behaviour change in Canada, and whether the influence of community-belonging on behaviour change varies by specific types of behaviours and contextual factors. Methods Data on individual-level community-belonging, socio-demographics and self-rated health were obtained for 119 693 respondents from the 2007/2008 Canadian Community Health Survey located within 100 health regions across Canada. Contextual factors were based on health-region groupings of socio-economic determinants of health. Multilevel models were used to estimate the influence of community-belonging and health-region contextual factors on general, and specific, health-behaviour changes in the past year. Results After controlling for individual and contextual factors, community-belonging showed a positive dose\textendash response relationship with health-behaviour change. Health-region contextual factors were only slightly associated with behaviour change; however, the influence of community-belonging on behaviour change showed significant variability based on health-region contextual factors. The influence of community-belonging also varied by specific health-behaviour changes, but for most prominent health behaviours (exercise, weight loss and improved diet) the effect was consistent. Conclusions Community-belonging was strongly related to health-behaviour change in Canada and may be an important component of population health prevention strategies. Efforts to increase community-belonging, however, need to be considered along with contextual factors.},

The Victorian Government defines this concept as being able to reach daily local living destinations within a 20-min round-trip walk from home, which is approximately 800m of walking for each trip leg. Similar concepts, such as 10- or 15-min cities, have been explored in other cities worldwide. However, research to date has largely focused on measuring accessibility to destinations in developed areas, with few studies examining what is needed to build a city of 20-min neighbourhoods, i.e., investigating multiple neighbourhoods, shared destinations, and the role of residential density. In this study, we used optimisation models to examine the relationship between residential density and the targets of 20-min neighbourhoods in a hypothetical greenfield development scenario. We defined different targets for various destinations in terms of the percentage of the population aimed to have access to that destination within 800m, ranging from 95\% for the smallest destinations to 70\% for the largest. Our results demonstrate that at least 25 dwellings per hectare (assuming 2.6 persons per dwelling) are needed to provide 800m access to the destinations within 1.2 km and 35 dwellings per hectare to provide access within 1km. Furthermore, we show that the cost of building destinations and the land required for them when delivering 20-min neighbourhoods at 30 dwellings per hectare is almost half of what is required when building at 15 dwellings per hectare.},

  abstract = {Immobility is known to impact health and well-being by reducing social contact, activity participation, and changing time use patterns. These unfortunate effects mostly affect specific demographic segments, including older adults, low income families, people who face disabilities, and those living in conflict zones. Emergency measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic mandated or strongly recommended limitations to mobility, thereby causing this condition for segments of the public not usually characterized by high levels of immobility. In the context of the pandemic, reduced mobility was the non-pharmaceutical intervention of choice, and the evidence suggests that it helped to keep incidences of the disease from exploding. On the other hand, there is also a need to understand how mobility restrictions may have had incidental impacts, including to well-being, in population groups that have not been studied from this perspective before. In this spirit, the present paper uses the items of the Satisfaction with Life Scale to investigate how aspects of well-being changed during the pandemic, using a sample of 400 college and university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Analysis is based on multivariate ordered models and the results suggest that being less mobile, less active, and changes in activity time use due COVID-19 had an impact on the satisfaction with life of students. The detrimental effect was more marked for males and students from low-income households. Additionally, perceptions of residential characteristics and sense of belonging also correlate with satisfaction with life in the period under study.},

  abstract = {Background Growing evidence suggests health benefits of natural environments. Yet, the effects of different types of natural environments (vegetation and water features) and forms of human-nature contact (access versus exposure) remain relatively unexplored. Methods A cross-sectional observational survey was used to analyse the relationship between both access and exposure to different types of urban natural environments and health outcomes in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Data for health outcomes (self-reported general health, mental health, and common mental disorders) and key confounders were obtained from the 2013\textendash 2014 Canadian Community Health Survey. Natural environments were quantified using local land use and land cover data, and linked to survey respondents by six-digit postal code. Access was defined as living within 300~m of a public greenspace ({$\geq$} 1 hectare) and exposure as the percentage of different land cover types within multiple buffer distances of postal code centroids. Separate logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations of the access and exposure metrics with the three health outcomes. Results Exposure to water within 1,000~m buffers was associated with a reduced odds of reporting poor general health (OR~=~0.982, 95\% CI~=~0.965, 0.999). A similar association was found for exposure to shrub and grass-herb vegetation types for reported mental health and common mental disorder, respectively (OR~=~0.741, 95\% CI~=~0.576, 0.953 for shrubs in 250~m; OR~=~0.737, 95\% CI~=~0.577, 0.942 for shrubs in 500~m; OR~=~0.731, 95\% CI~=~0.570, 0.938 for shrubs in 1,000~m; OR~=~0.980, 95\% CI~=~0.965, 0.995 for grass-herbs in 250~m). Neither access to public greenspace nor aggregated greenspace exposure were associated with self-reported health. Results from stratified analyses suggest that observed associations between human-nature contact and self-reported health differ according to gender. Conclusions Results suggest that type of natural environment should be considered in future research studying the health-promoting aspects of natural environments, and that positive health effects may be more consistent for daily life exposure than for access to public greenspace.},

  abstract = {In this classic work of feminist political thought, Iris Marion Young challenges the prevailing reduction of social justice to distributive justice. It critically analyzes basic concepts underlying most theories of justice, including impartiality, formal equality, and the unitary moral subjectivity. The starting point for her critique is the experience and concerns of the new social movements about decision making, cultural expression, and division of labor--that were created by marginal and excluded groups, including women, African Americans, and American Indians, as well as gays and lesbians. Iris Young defines concepts of domination and oppression to cover issues eluding the distributive model. Democratic theorists, according to Young do not adequately address the problem of an inclusive participatory framework. By assuming a homogeneous public, they fail to consider institutional arrangements for including people not culturally identified with white European male norms of reason and respectability. Young urges that normative theory and public policy should undermine group-based oppression by affirming rather than suppressing social group difference. Basing her vision of the good society on the differentiated, culturally plural network of contemporary urban life, she argues for a principle of group representation in democratic publics and for group-differentiated policies. {$<$}br{$>$}  Danielle Allen's new foreword contextualizes Young's work and explains how debates surrounding social justice have changed since--and been transformed by--the original publication of {$<$}em{$>$}Justice and the Politics of Difference.},

  abstract = {Background. Older persons reporting disability are more likely to report poor self-rated health, but little work has been done to assess the independent relationships of reported walking difficulty and measured walking performance with self-rated health. This study examines the associations of walking difficulty, walking speed, and age with self-rated health in older women.Methods. The data are from the baseline of the Women's Health and Aging Study. Difficulty walking one quarter mile was used as a measure of mobility in the representative population aged 65 and older screened for the study (n = 3841) and in the one third most disabled study group (n = 1002). Maximal walking speed was measured in the study sample.Results. Increasing severity of walking difficulty (in the screened population and in the disabled study group), slower walking speed (in the study group), and younger age were all associated with fair or poor self-rated health, after simultaneous adjustment for these and other objective measures of physical performance and health. The associations of both measures of walking with self-rated health weakened with age.Conclusions. Both walking difficulty and walking speed are independent determinants of self-rated health. Adjusted for health and functioning, self-rated health tends to improve with age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Access to health facilities remains limited in many resource-poor settings, and women and their children often have to travel far to seek care.  However, data on distance are scarce, and it is unclear whether distance is  associated with worse child health outcomes. We estimate the relationships between  distance to facility, service utilization and child mortality in low- and  middle-income countries. METHODS: Population-representative data are pooled from 29  demographic and health surveys across 21 low- and middle-income countries.  Multivariable logistic models and meta-analysis regressions are used to estimate  associations between facility distance, child mortality, and health care utilization  in the pooled sample as well as for each survey. RESULTS: Compared with children who  live within 1\,km of a facility, children living within 2\,km, 3\,km, and 5\,km of a  facility have a 7.7\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.927 - 1.251], 16.3\% (95\% CI:  1.020 - 1.327) and 25\% (95\% CI: 1.087 - 1.439) higher odds of neonatal mortality,  respectively; children living farther than 10\,km have a 26.6\% (95\% CI: 1.108 -  1.445) higher odds of neonatal mortality. Women living farther than 10\,km from a  facility have a 55.3\% lower odds of in-facility delivery compared with women who  live within 1\,km [odds ratio (OR): 0.447; 95\% CI: 0.394 - 0.508]. CONCLUSIONS: Even  relatively small distances from health facilities are associated with substantial  mortality penalties for children. Policies that reduce travel distances and travel  times are likely to increase utilization of health services and reduce neonatal  mortality.},

Using a sample of leading journals, we document this tendency and suggest reasons why researchers prefer tables. We argue that the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results. We illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression results. We show that regression graphs emphasize point estimates and confidence intervals and that they can successfully present the results of regression models. A move away from tables towards graphs would improve the discipline's communicative output and make empirical findings more accessible to every type of audience.Jonathan P.

  abstract = {Social and territorial structures form intricate relations that transcend a social stratification or spatial focus. Territorial features and geographic displacements are structuring principles for society, as societal features and social change effect the structure and use of territory. Based on our examination of the conceptual and theoretical links between spatial and social mobility, we propose a concept that represents a new form of inequality. Termed ?motility?, this construct describes the potential and actual capacity of goods, information or people to be mobile both geographically and socially. Three major features of motility ? access, competence and appropriation ? are introduced. In this article, we focus on conceptual and theoretical contributions of motility. In addition, we suggest a number of possible empirical investigations. Motility presents us with an innovative perspective on societal changes without prematurely committing researchers to work within structuralist or postmodern perspectives. More generally, we propose to revisit the fluidification debate in the social sciences with a battery of questions that do not begin and end with whether or not society is in flux. Instead, we introduce a field of research that takes advantage of the insights from competing paradigms in order to reveal the social dynamics and consequences of displacements in geographic and social space. Les structures sociales et territoriales forment des relations complexes qui d\'epassent toute stratification sociale ou convergence spatiale. Les caract\'eristiques territoriales et d\'eplacements g\'eographiques sont, pour la soci\'et\'e, des principes structurants, tout comme les caract\'eristiques soci\'etales et le changement social font na\^itre la structure et l'usage d'un territoire. A partir d'un examen des liens conceptuels et th\'eoriques entre les mobilit\'es spatiale et sociale, cet article propose un concept traduisant une nouvelle forme d'in\'egalit\'e: appel\'e?motilit\'e?, il d\'ecrit le potentiel et l'aptitude r\'eelle des marchandises, informations ou individus \`a\^etre mobiles sur un plan tant g\'eographique que social. Trois traits essentiels de la motilit\'e? acc\`es, comp\'etence et appropriation ? sont pr\'esent\'es. Si l'article s'attache aux contributions conceptuelles et th\'eoriques de la motilit\'e, il sugg\`ere aussi plusieurs axes possibles d'\'etudes empiriques. La motilit\'e offre une perspective novatrice sur les changements soci\'etaux, sans engager pr\'ematur\'ement les travaux de recherches sur des rails structuralistes ou post-modernes. Plus g\'en\'eralement, il s'agit de revisiter le d\'ebat sur la fluidification en sciences sociales \`a l'aide d'une batterie de questions qui, ni au d\'ebut ni \`a la fin, ne demande si la soci\'et\'e est fluctuante ou non. En revanche, l'article propose un domaine de recherches qui exploite les r\'eflexions tir\'ees de paradigmes concurrents afin de r\'ev\'eler la dynamique sociale et les cons\'equences des d\'eplacements dans l'espace g\'eographique et social.}

Drawing on the conceptualization of circuits of knowledge, the paper scrutinizes the extent to which transport policy agendas are framed around various approaches within academia. An extensive literature review reveals that the academic field of transport and mobility is organized around a hegemonic core of ``neoclassical'' and ``sustainable'' approaches. Meanwhile, a critique of these dominant approaches is emerging in an attempt to (re)embed mobility issues in urban political economy. This threefold knowledge typology visibly resonates within transport policy agendas in Brussels, where we detect a growth-oriented and largely depoliticized dual hegemony of neoclassical and sustainable narratives, with critical academic voices rarely entering official agendas. The paper concludes with a reflection on the difficulties, yet also the need to mobilize critical academic knowledge in the field of transport and mobility.},

  abstract = {A common causal identification strategy in political science is selection on observables. This strategy assumes one observes a set of covariates that is, after statistical adjustment, sufficient to make treatment status as-if random. Under adjustment methods such as matching or inverse probability weighting, coefficients for control variables are treated as nuisance parameters and are not directly estimated. This is in direct contrast to regression approaches where estimated parameters are obtained for all covariates. Analysts often find it tempting to give a causal interpretation to all the parameters in such regression models\textemdash indeed, such interpretations are often central to the proposed research design. In this paper, we ask when we can justify interpreting two or more coefficients in a regression model as causal parameters. We demonstrate that analysts must appeal to causal identification assumptions to give estimates causal interpretations. Under selection on observables, this task is complicated by the fact that more than one causal effect might be identified. We show how causal graphs provide a framework for clearly delineating which effects are presumed to be identified and thus merit a causal interpretation, and which are not. We conclude with a set of recommendations for how researchers should interpret estimates from regression models when causal inference is the goal.},

The insertion of the region's suburban communities into the global city was taken to a certain extreme in Compton, south of Los Angeles, one of the poorest suburbs in the United States. In the future, we need to address both the difference between central city and suburbs as well as the diversity within the latter, including their hybrid, in-between, and postsuburban forms.},

Studies were excluded that included children (including maternity), emergency medical travel or countries classed as being in the global south. SETTINGS: A wide range of settings within primary and secondary care (these were not restricted in the search). RESULTS: 108 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results were mixed. 77\% of the included studies identified evidence of a distance decay association, whereby patients living further away from healthcare facilities they needed to attend had worse health outcomes (eg, survival rates, length of stay in hospital and non-attendance at follow-up) than those who lived closer. 6 of the studies identified the reverse (a distance bias effect) whereby patients living at a greater distance had better health outcomes. The remaining 19 studies found no relationship. There was a large variation in the data available to the studies on the patients' geographical locations and the healthcare facilities attended, and the methods used to calculate travel times and distances were not consistent across studies. CONCLUSIONS: The review observed that a relationship between travelling further and having worse health outcomes cannot be ruled out and should be considered within the healthcare services location debate.},

What is less clear is the prescription for how to move towards a more sustainable future, especially given the many interest groups involved, the complexity of urban systems and the fragmented nature of decision-making in most urban regions. It is argued that the process of achieving more sustainable transportation requires suitable establishment of four pillars: effective governance of land use and transportation; fair, efficient, stable funding; strategic infrastructure investments; and attention to neighbourhood design. A review of each pillar identifies key issues. The characteristics of an ideal body for governance of land use and transportation are considered. Trade-offs are identified with: spatial representation; organizational structure; democracy; and market philosophy. Effective financing and pricing of urban transportation may be distorted because responsibility for infrastructure is separated from service provision. Financing mechanisms are categorized depending on vehicle use and location. Investment in infrastructure for alternative fuel vehicles and intermediate semi-rapid transit may be required in many cities. Major investment in public transit infrastructure will likely not suffice if macro land use and micro neighbourhood designs are not supportive of these investments.},

SUBJECTS: Civilian, non-institutionalised (that is, non-incarcerated and non-hospitalised) US residents aged 18 years or older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self rated health status. RESULTS: When personal characteristics and household income were controlled for, individuals living in states with the greatest inequalities in income were 30\% more likely to report their health as fair or poor than individuals living in states with the smallest inequalities in income.

  abstract = {A scientific consensus has recently emerged suggesting that the dominant twentieth century paradigm of solving transportation congestion problems by building more freeways failed. The legacy of the freeway construction era is clearly visible in polluted and congested cities worldwide. To battle these ills, planning academics have been promoting more sustainable built form aligned with dedicated public/active transport provision. Partly as a result of the push coming from academia, a number of cities have sought to remove their freeways and replace the freed up space with alternate transport infrastructure, such as streets and boulevards. To discern if the transportation planning profession is currently undergoing a paradigm shift or whether freeway removal is merely a temporary fad, we have conducted a systematic review of the literature. In this article, we unpack the underlying reasons which have led some cities to removing their freeways. Results reveal that a paradigm shift has arguably not yet taken place in transportation planning. While many cities are creating human-scale and active transport spaces, currently these spaces tend to coexist alongside freeways. American cities, which were once the pioneers of freeway construction, appear to be lagging behind cities in Europe and Asia in this respect. If the current pace of freeway removal continues, it may take a few decades before the transportation planners, politicians, policy makers, and communities adopt radically different norms, methods, and goals. However, a radical approach may need to be taken sooner given alarming global warming predictions.},

It is in this vein that the current paper presents an integrated approach, drawing partially from past contributions, to measuring potential spatial access to health care services. The final access index is derived as the culmination of a series of individual measures, starting with an initial gravity formulation and progressing through successive stages as new elements, consistent with the definition and conceptualization of potential spatial access, are introduced. Application of the proposed index to the ambulatory medical care system of the Akron, Ohio SMSA, demonstrates the validity of the measure, and its suitability as a potential health care planning tool.},

Nepal's health system focuses on life-saving interventions provided during the antenatal to postpartum period. However, the inequality in the uptake of maternity services is of major concern. This study aimed to synthesise evidence from the literature regarding the social determinants of health on the use of maternity services in Nepal. We conducted a structured narrative review of studies published from 1994 to 2016. We searched five databases: PubMed; CINAHL; EMBASE; ProQuest and Global Index Medicus using search terms covering four domains: access and use; equity determinants; routine maternity services and Nepal. The findings of the studies were summarised using the World Health Organization's Social Determinants of Health framework. A total of 59 studies were reviewed. A range of socio-structural and intermediary-level determinants was identified, either as facilitating factors, or as barriers, to the uptake of maternity services. These determinants were higher socioeconomic status; education; privileged ethnicities such as Brahmins/Chhetris, people following the Hindu religion; accessible geography; access to transportation; family support; women's autonomy and empowerment; and a birth preparedness plan. Findings indicate the need for health and non-health sector interventions, including education linked to job opportunities; mainstreaming of marginalised communities in economic activities and provision of skilled providers, equipment and medicines. Interventions to improve maternal health should be viewed using a broad `social determinants of health' framework.},

The procedure rests on the assumption that an efficient alternative should be selected that maximizes the net aggregate benefits to society as a whole. However, this selection results in projects that invariably provide different levels of benefits to members of a community, thus contravening the principles of equity or distributive justice. Six strategies for dealing with the problem of distributive justice are explored and examined and then applied in a common setting to a public project where several efficient alternatives are proposed. While this research is not prompted by the desire to proclaim a winner from among the strategies, it is evident that some strategies make heroic attempts to reduce inequity. Issues connected with obtaining public consensus are also briefly mentioned.},

First, socio-economic and neighborhood characteristics were regressed against number and proportion of trips by various modes. The best models for each measure of travel behavior confirmed that neighborhood characteristics add significant explanatory power when socio-economic differences are controlled for. Specifically, measures of residential density, public transit accessibility, mixed land use, and the presence of sidewalks are significantly associated with trip generation by mode and modal split. Second, 39 attitude statements relating to urban life were factor analyzed into eight factors: pro-environment, pro-transit, suburbanite, automotive mobility, time pressure, urban villager, TCM, and workaholic. Scores on these factors were introduced into the six best models discussed above. The relative contributions of the socio-economic, neighborhood, and attitudinal blocks of variables were assessed. While each block of variables offers some significant explanatory power to the models, the attitudinal variables explained the highest proportion of the variation in the data. The finding that attitudes are more strongly associated with travel than are land use characteristics suggests that land use policies promoting higher densities and mixtures may not alter travel demand materially unless residents' attitudes are also changed.},

This paper summarizes and evaluates the international literature that deals with social costs as a consequence of suburbanization: comprehensive `development impact studies'; studies on `public service costs'; and those simulating the local `fiscal impact' of various development scenarios. Such a review is needed because all studies are based on different approaches, methods and scope, as well as differences in the cost items considered. They show significantly different results. Due to the resulting complexity of comparison and evaluation, and the lack of transferability of the results to other areas, a state-of-the-art evaluation is helpful. This paper focuses mainly on the involvement of demographical changes beyond the growth paradigm, the consideration of environmental effects, and the consideration of cost burden/repayment of public costs according to the cost-by-causer principle. Using tabular comparisons of different study types, it is shown that various studies obtained different qualitative and numerical results, depending on the methodology and detail or representing different land-use patterns. Notwithstanding the different international legal frameworks, an international agreement by researchers towards a common methodology is necessary in order to enable more efficient `fiscal impact' analyses as an instrument towards more compact, cost-saving development, and thus avoid unnecessary social costs by increasing the efficiency.},

Secondly, the current crisis of rising costs of living is intensifying the discussion about public transport for fare-free or greatly reduced prices. Measures that some EU member states have taken are discussed. The social justice dimension is also reflected in the context of area justice and urban heat waves. Thirdly, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the financing of public transport to such an extent that it opens a window of opportunity to gain new allies for fare-free. Fourthly, the discussion about the war in Ukraine also opens up the possibility of taking a new look at public transport, as it can contribute significantly to energy savings. Last but not least, the current discussion on industrial policy as a reply to the American Inflation Reduction Act is an opportunity to strengthen public transport and fare-free public transport discourse.},

  abstract = {Connectivity of more than one mode to a line haul in an urban area constitutes the multimodal transport system of the city. In this paper New Delhi has been taken up as a case study to evaluate performance of multimodal transportation system (MMTS), where metro became main mode in routine public transport trips. Public transport in Delhi carries only about 60\% of total vehicular person trips as against 80\% of the expected population size of the city. The present bus services, metro rail and IRBT (Integrated Rail-cum-Bus Transit), if implemented as planned together are estimated to carry about 15 million trips per day by 2021. Since, all the public transport trips are multimodal, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of multimodal transportation systems. The study is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the study of travel time elements (access time, transfer time, waiting time, line-haul time, and egress time) is done. Next, the influence of access and egress times on the total travel time is examined. Use is made of a comprehensive commuter travel diary to collect detail travel time estimates. A representative commuter survey, with 460 respondents, is drawn on platform at each station of Red Line and Yellow Line (Kashmiri Gate \textendash{} Saket) Delhi Metro. Implementing the Second phase of study, performance measures such as Travel Time Ratio, Level of Service, Interconnectivity Ratio, Passenger Waiting Index, and Running Index were evaluated. Interconnectivity ratio (proportion of access and egress time w.r.t total travel time) for various combinations such as Mixed-Metro-Mixed, Walk-Metro-Walk, Walk-Metro-Bus and Walk- Bus-Walk has been observed. Travel Time (defined as the time differential between private transport and public transport) ratio shows much variation with trip direction, time of day, mode used, and distance travelled, etc.,. Level of Service Indicator (Out- of-vehicle Travel Time/In-Vehicle Travel Time) ratio inferred that people spends more time out-of-vehicle as compared to that of in-vehicle. Access time, transfer time, waiting time and egress time are the most important and complex travel time elements that transport systems should consider improving its efficiency and modal share. The results can be used in planning catchment area of public transport. Access and egress (together with waiting and transfer times) appear as factors that affect effectiveness and performance of a multimodal transportation system to a larger extent as unacceptable distances are likely to reduce ridership patronage. At the same time, there are key deciding factors when a trip originates as to whether the commuter shall choose public transit over personal mode of travel.},

  abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more ?gender sensitive? and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.}

  abstract = {Assuring equal accessibility to public outdoor and recreation services is important because of the potential health and social welfare implications. The focus has primarily been on parks and other green spaces but should be expanded to include also the aquatic environments and the numerous recreational opportunities they have to offer. As the accessibility standards and approaches on ensuring equal accessibility to green spaces are often based on purely spatial measurements, this research examined the equality of accessibility of aquatic environments by combining spatio-temporal dimensions of accessibility with person-based measures. Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) method used in the study provided multifaceted knowledge on the person-based accessibility patterns related to aquatic environments in Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. This paper demonstrates how an advanced GIS-based analysis combining both objective and subjective measurements of accessibility can result in more detailed and even contradictory outcomes compared to traditional spatial measures. The results indicate that a common presumption of a nearest service available made in studies on accessibility and environmental justice may have notable impacts on results or even return unfounded interpretations. Results also indicate that there are significant (p{$<$}0.05) differences in accessibility in the study region related to income status and car ownership. We conclude that PPGIS approaches can provide valuable information to accessibility research, studies on environmental justice and provide additional approaches for the planning and management officials of public recreation and outdoor services.},

A two-step, limited information maximum likelihood estimator is proposed to fill this gap. The estimator is developed assuming a Poisson distribution, but can be extended to other count distributions. The small sample properties of the estimator are evaluated with Monte Carlo experiments. Simulation results suggest that the spatial lag count estimator achieves gains in terms of bias over the aspatial version as spatial lag autocorrelation and sample size increase. An empirical example deals with the location choice of single-unit start-up firms in the manufacturing industry in the US between 2000 and 2004. The empirical results suggest that in the dynamic process of firm formation, counties dominated by firms exhibiting internal increasing returns to scale are at a relative disadvantage even if localization economies are present.},

In study 1, 237 users of public transport rated PAC. The results showed that PAC is a reliable measure. The PAC was further validated and proved reliable in two waves (study 2) in altered conditions (Wave 1, N=246, Wave 2, N=259). Based on this, an overall PAC index was constructed. PAC can be used to determine the traveler's (or possible travelers) opinion of accessibility in transport planning or accessibility-mapping, or for directing interventions aimed at improving accessibility to where they are best needed according to the individuals. Further development of the PAC and its potential within transport research and planning, and its future validation is discussed.},

In this paper, we 1) further develop the PAC measure of perceived accessibility in order to capture how easy it is to live a satisfactory life with the help of the transport system, 2) compare levels of perceived accessibility between residential areas and main travel modes, and 3) compare residents' perceived accessibility to the objective accessibility level for the same residential area. Data from 2711 residents of Malm\"o, Sweden show that perceived accessibility is consistently different from objective accessibility across 13 residential areas, with minor differences in levels of perceived accessibility between areas. Surprisingly, bicycle users rate their accessibility significantly higher than those who mainly use the car or public transport for daily travel, contrary to objective accessibility assumptions. These differences point at the importance of including perceived accessibility as a complementary tool when planning for and evaluating transport systems.},

Cities and transit agencies have been increasingly interested in adding environmental and equity considerations to this equation.

This article contributes to CoT's goal by developing a web-based tool to help managers at the Transportation Services Division assess the equity performance of infrastructure projects under their care. The tool's output is a quantitative score which is based on the demographic and transportation profile of those who live around the project location and on the anticipated impacts of the project. This article summarizes an applied research partnership between the University of Toronto and the City of Toronto over an 18-month period, contributing to advance the state-of-practice in Canadian cities. As the City of Toronto faces a major budget shortfall, this new tool shows great promise to support equity-oriented project prioritization. More broadly, we hope that reporting our experience will prompt other cities to make equity an integral part of their infrastructure planning and delivery process.},

The current mode of large-scale urban development is, however, different from its predecessor in so far as its focus is flexible and diverse rather than singular and monolithic. However, the diversity that the new approach offers, we argue, forecloses upon a wide variety of social practices, reproducing rather than resolving urban inequality and disenfranchisement. Further, we suggest that the diversity of forms and land uses employed in these mega-projects inhibits the growth of oppositional and contestational practices. The new mega-project also demonstrates a shift from collective benefits to a more individualized form of public benefit. The article is based on Toronto's recent waterfront development proposals, which we identify as an example of a new paradigm of mega-project development within the framework of the competitive city. Its stated but paradoxical goal is to specialize in everything, allowing for the pretence that all interests are being served while simultaneously re-inscribing and reinforcing socioeconomic divisions. Our findings are centred on four areas: institutional change; the importance of mega-projects to global interurban competition; the exclusive nature of public participation processes; and the increasing commodification and circumscription of urban public space.},

Little attention has been paid to accessibility modelling, variations among population groups, and the influence of land use arrangement and transport infrastructure in Chinese cities. To address this deficiency, the present paper provides measures on the job accessibility of workers with different hukou status in Guangzhou. The study yields the following findings: 1) inner-city districts have better job accessibility compared to suburban areas; 2) local hukou workers have significantly higher job accessibility than non-local hukou workers; 3) job suburbanization seems not to be effective in improving job accessibility or narrowing the gap between local and non-local hukou workers; and 4) investment in public transport would significantly improve the mobility and job accessibility of non-local hukou workers and help to alleviate accessibility inequality.},

Psychological distress was independently associated with worse self-rated health among the poorest, while perceptions by the wealthiest were broader, including psychological distress, insomnia, Trypanosoma cruzi infection, use of medications, and access to health services. Physician visits and hospitalizations were associated with self-rated health in both groups. Our results show important differences in the structure of self-rated health according to socioeconomic circumstances and reinforce the need for policies to reduce health inequalities in later life.},

Despite increasing evidence of the importance of transportation equity, there are broad questions about how equity principles factor into planning processes. This work provides an empirical analysis of the role of transit equity in planning for BRT investments in three Canadian metropolitan areas. Our findings show that transit equity rarely figured into the design and planning of BRT systems and there is a lack of clarity in both defining equity and determining how it should be integrated in planning processes. Most definitions of transit equity focused on the equal distribution of resources for all groups, rather than consideration of transit-dependent riders. Equity outcomes were also in conflict with other goals, as BRT systems were viewed largely as a tool for encouraging development and focused on attracting car drivers to transit. This paper argues that there needs to be a better understanding of the values and priorities of those involved in professional and political decision-making processes if transit equity goals are to be realized.},

We find that the lived experiences of equity-deserving groups are well documented, in both the academic literature, and in work by community-based organizations, non-profits and advocacy groups. Four cross-cutting themes were observed across equity-deserving groups: poor or absent transit service; unaffordability of transit fares; policing and enforcement; and safety. The research demonstrated that poor and unaffordable transit impacts equity-deserving groups in wide-ranging ways, such as restricting access to healthcare, education and employment; limiting support for people experiencing domestic violence; and, reducing the ability of people to access social services, visit with family and friends, and participate in cultural activities.},

  abstract = {The world population is ageing, and many countries in the world are confronted by significant challenges in adapting their health and social systems to meet the requirements of this demographic change. It is well-accepted that mobility is often closely linked to a person's independence, wellbeing and quality of life. Interest has increased across the world with regard to how the mobility needs of an ageing society can be addressed, since an ageing population is confronting nations across the globe and poses long-term challenges on a nation's many aspects, including transport. Questions of how future policies can better respond to the mobility needs of an ageing population and how these policies can be delivered have emerged as major concerns for transport planners, operators and decision-makers. This review explores the way in which implemented policies have addressed the mobility needs of an ageing society, focusing on the provision of accessible, safe and affordable transport. More specifically, the paper reviews legislative and institutional approaches of addressing the mobility needs of an ageing population. The paper discusses the outcomes of these approaches and the remaining challenges in this policy area that relate to elderly people's mobility and provides future research directions. Based on the discussion, clear conclusions about the effectiveness of particular policies are difficult to make. Alternative approaches (e.g., technological innovations) need to be considered in addressing older people's mobility needs.},

  abstract = {A higher Body Mass Index (BMI) is often associated with higher risks for health-related issues (e.g., arthritis, cancer). Lifestyle behaviors (e.g., healthy diet) are believed to be important factors closely related to people's BMI and health. Among the behaviors, active travel modes (e.g., walking and bicycling) may be an important factor correlated with BMI. Such travel behaviors can somehow be affected by community design (e.g., walkability) and environmental features (e.g., air quality). These factors exhibit complex relationships with a person's health as they may either directly or indirectly correlate with health through travel behaviors. To this end, this study employed a pathway analysis approach to unveil potential health benefits relating to community living environments and travel behaviors to BMI and health. Specifically, this study integrated national-level health and travel behavior datasets and developed rigorous multi-level hierarchical models to explore and explain how the health pathways are related to community living environments, travel behaviors, and BMI. The modeling results showed that limited walking facilities and unhealthy air quality could significantly associate with people's reduced willingness to engage in active travel modes, which correlated with subsequent higher obesity risk, and a higher risk of poor health. More importantly, if walking or bicycling facilities were not fully utilized, health benefits gained from these facilities were found to be substantially reduced. Other significant health-related behaviors (e.g., sleep/exercise time, fruit consumption, smoking) are also discussed in detail.},

The methods are illustrated by using data from an arthritis clinical trial comparing the drug auranofin and placebo therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, in which the response is a self-assessment of arthritis, classified as poor, fair and good. The covariates of interest are age, gender, treatment and base-line response. A proportional odds model is fitted to the data, and the proposed goodness-of-fit statistics are applied to the fitted model. Also, the small sample properties of the proposed goodness-of-fit statistics are compared in a simulation study.},

By calculating the up-to-standard rates of public service facilities in each district, it is found that the allocation of medical facilities and commercial facilities in urban community life circle is relatively perfect, but the allocation of public cultural facilities and pension facilities is obviously inadequate. Based on this, optimization suggestions on the layout of public service facilities in the 15-minute life circle were put forward from three aspects: facilities sharing, function mixing and population structure and activity characteristics differentiation. It not only provides data and technical support for the planning and construction of community life circle in Baoding city, but also provides referable examples and promotable models for the community planning of third-tier cities.},

A new paradigm recognizes that the ultimate goal of most transport activity is accessibility, which refers to people's overall ability to reach desired services and activities. This new paradigm applies more comprehensive and multi-modal evaluation which expands the range of modes, objectives, impacts and options considered in the planning process.

Regression analyses reveal that communities with higher proportions of essential workers, vulnerable populations (African American, Hispanic, Female, and people over 45 years old), and more coronavirus Google searches tend to maintain higher levels of minimal demand during COVID-19. Approximately half of the agencies experienced their decline before the local spread of COVID-19 likely began; most of these are in the US Midwest. Almost no transit systems finished their decline periods before local community spread. We also compare hourly demand profiles for each system before and during COVID-19 using ordinary Procrustes distance analysis. The results show substantial departures from typical weekday hourly demand profiles. Our results provide insights into public transit as an essential service during a pandemic.},

  abstract = {Directing growth towards denser communities with mixed-use, accessible, and walkable neighborhood design has become an important strategy for promoting sustainability, but few studies have examined whether compact development strategies could help reduce within-household gender disparities in spatial behavior by increasing accessibility. We analyze spatial behavior of heterosexual married couples in Southern California based on the 2012 California Household Travel Survey and find that households living in areas with greater regional accessibility and neighborhood walkability have smaller, more centered, and more compact activity spaces overall compared to households in less compact areas, and that married pairs living in more accessible areas have greater equality in the size and centeredness of their activity spaces. We account for residential selection bias in our multivariate analysis and find that a ten unit increase in near-residence Walk Score was associated with a 12\textendash 18\% decrease in activity space size, a 6\textendash 8\% decrease in residential distancing, and a 12\textendash 13\% increase in spatial concentration for both men and women. Men and women, however, had significantly different activity space behaviors regardless of their neighborhood type. Compared to women, men on average had larger activity spaces and conducted their activities farther from home. Overall, results support our hypothesis that compact development provides married couples greater flexibility in how they divide household out-of-home activities by making destinations more convenient and lowering the overall spatial fixity of these activities. Future research and planning efforts should carefully consider which aspects of compact, accessible development are most effective for a given local context.},

This study aimed at understanding with a qualitative and longitudinal perspective how older people stay (auto-)mobile in their house and their neighborhood against the need to adapt to reduced autonomy and mobility over time. A group of 22 suburbanites aged from 62 to 89 was interviewed in 1999 and in 2006. The results show that even if older people succeed in increasing their mobility, they are headed for inevitable immobility. Among the environmental adaptation strategies that were observed, the constructed behaviors, the dependencies demanding additional supports as well as the social life modulate different evolving experiences of the city: the shrinking city, the fragmented city, and the city by proxy. The built environment is at the heart of a complex process in which the adaptation of mobility contributes to the emergence of new residential experiences.},

We propose here a stochastic theory of urban growth which accounts for some of the observed scalings and we confirm these predictions on US and OECD empirical data. In particular, we show that the dependence on population size of the total number of miles driven daily, the total length of the road network, the total traffic delay, the total consumption of gasoline, the quantity of CO2 emitted and the relation between area and population of cities, are all governed by a single parameter which characterizes the sensitivity to congestion. Our results suggest that diseconomies associated with congestion scale superlinearly with population size, implying that \textendash despite polycentrism\textendash{} cities whose transportation infrastructure rely heavily on traffic sensitive modes are unsustainable.},

Although these methodologies vary according to the ways in which different Indigenous communities express their own unique knowledge systems, they do have common traits. This article argues that research on Indigenous issues should be carried out in a manner which is respectful and ethically sound from an Indigenous perspective. This naturally challenges Western research paradigms, yet it also affords opportunities to contribute to the body of knowledge about Indigenous peoples. It is further argued that providing a mechanism for Indigenous peoples to participate in and direct these research agendas ensures that their communal needs are met, and that geographers then learn how to build ethical research relationships with them. Indigenous methodologies do not privilege Indigenous researchers because of their Indigeneity, since there are many `insider' views, and these are thus suitable for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers. However, there is a difference between research done within an Indigenous context using Western methodologies and research done using Indigenous methodologies which integrates Indigenous voices. This paper will discuss those differences while presenting a historical context of research on Indigenous peoples, providing further insights into what Indigenous methodologies entail, and proposing ways in which the academy can create space for this discourse.},

However, understanding this is highly relevant for policymakers to understand the impacts of their transport decisions. These dimensions include the distribution of mobility and accessibility levels over particular areas or for specific population groups, as well as how this may affect various social outcomes, including their levels of participation, social inclusion and community cohesion. In response, we propose a method to assess the socially relevant accessibility impacts (SRAIs) of policies in some of these key dimensions. The method combines the use of underlying ethics principles, more specifically the theories of egalitarianism and sufficientarianism, in combination with accessibility-based analysis and the Lorenz curve and Gini index. We then demonstrate the method in a case study example. Our suggestion is that policymakers can use these ethical perspectives to determine the equity of their policies decisions and to set minimum standards for local transport delivery. This will help them to become more confident in the development and adoption of new decision frameworks that promote accessibility over mobility and which also disaggregate the costs and benefits of transport policies over particular areas or for specific under-served population groups.},

What precisely constitutes transport poverty is not adequately articulated within academic, policy or infrastructure design literature. This paper aims to demonstrate how the different ways that academic studies and policy programmes have defined and recorded the problem of transport poverty is directly related to the ways in which it has been subsequently addressed in practice. The overall impression is one of inadequacy, fragmentation, inconsistency and tokenistic treatment of an issue that potentially affects anywhere between 10 to 90\% of all households, depending on which definition is used and which country is being considered. This suggests that it is a far greater problem than the transport profession has previously been prepared to recognise and one that requires its urgent attention given the continuing trends for mass migration, urbanisation and wealth concentration within and between the `global north' and `global south'.},

The main aim of the research was to identify the extent to which the revealed travel behavioural outcomes of the study participants are due to personal social constraints or environmental conditions in their residential locations. Specifically, we sought to identify if the greater access to local amenities and public transport services of inner city residents led to an increase in their daily travel activities when compared with their urban peripheral counterparts. The research analysed data from a personal travel survey and one-day travel diary with 502 adults aged between 16 and 65\,years in two different deprived areas in Merseyside, North West England. Our analysis is somewhat hampered by the small sample size, but the modelled results suggest that more trips, and longer journey distances do not necessarily imply greater social inclusion. The geographically weighted regression models (GWR) highlighted that the physical location of where people live within the city is more influential on their trip-making patterns than social determinants such as household income, age, gender, and/or employment status. Street connectivity, the level of bus services and neighbourhood safety were all particularly significant for determining spatial variations in the daily trips that were undertaken, with more trips being undertaken where there was a greater density of street nodes, bus stops and where people felt safer at night. This highlights the need for local transport and urban policymakers to carefully consider and target these micro-scale factors when attempting to introduce transport interventions to reduce social exclusion amongst low-income urban populations.},

  abstract = {The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a growing interest amongst UK academics and policy makers in the issue of transport disadvantage and, more innovatively, how this might relate to growing concerns about the social exclusion of low income groups and communities. Studies (predominantly in the United Kingdom) began to make more explicit the links policy between poverty, transport disadvantage, access to key services and economic and social exclusion (see for example Church and Frost, 2000; TRaC, 2000, Lucas et al., 2001, Kenyon, 2003, Kenyon et al., 2003, Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Raje, 2003). By 2003, the UK Social Exclusion Unit had published and its now internationally recognised report on this subject, which subsequently resulted in the development of a set of transport policy guidances to local authorities in England to deliver what is now commonly referred to as accessibility planning as part of their Local Transport Plans (Department for Transport, 2006). Since this time, researchers, policy makers and practitioners in several other countries became interested in adopting a social exclusion approach to transport planning, largely because of its utility in identifying the role of transport, land use planning and service delivery decisions in creating and reinforcing poverty and social disadvantage. Eight years on from the SEU report, we can begin to reflect on the extent to which a social exclusion approach to the research of transport disadvantage has been successful in opening up new avenues of research enquiry and/or identifying new theoretical perspectives and/or methodological approaches. The paper begins by briefly revisiting the basic theories and core definitions which underpin and inform a social exclusion perspective. It then considers how these have been translated and understood in terms of transport. Secondly, it considers some of the emergent empirical research of transport-related exclusion that has attempted to measure and model the interactions between transport and mobility inequalities and relational negative social outcomes. Thirdly, it offers observations on progress in some key areas of policy and practice, with specific reference to the UK and Australia. It concludes by suggesting how further progress might be made on this issue and considers whether the social exclusion agenda is still a relevant approach for achieving this.},

  abstract = {Most transport equity and transport-related social exclusion (TRSE) studies assume that increasing accessibility levels lead to increased activity participation and, therefore, a reduction in social exclusion. Although this assumption makes sense from a theoretical point of view, this causal relationship has not yet been validated in practice. Previous studies investigating the accessibility-participation relationship were inconclusive, indicating that increasing accessibility has a limited impact on activity participation levels, if any. Moreover, the existing empirical evidence in the literature in the Global South context is scarce, is merely correlational and fails to infer causality between both variables. The contributions of the paper are threefold. First, (a) to provide a conceptual model of the causal relationship between accessibility, activity participation and risk of transport-related social exclusion (TRSE); second, (b) to summarise the available empirical evidence about the accessibility-activity participation relationship through a systematic literature review; and third, (c) to provide evidence of the causal relationship between accessibility and activity participation levels in a Global South context. Three Poisson regression models associated with an instrumental variable identification strategy were used to assess the causal effect between accessibility and participation in total, mandatory and discretionary activities in the city of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil. The three models showed a highly significant, strong correlation between an individual's accessibility level and their actual participation in total, mandatory and discretionary activities. Models that ignore the possible endogeneity present in the relationship between accessibility and activity participation may underestimate the effect of accessibility. Based on our results, we argue that low accessibility levels may severely restrict individuals' life chances and add evidence that accessibility has to be an important instrument to support transport policies' decision-making.},

To address the literature lack of conceptual clarity, we provided a framework that considers how individuals may be prevented from travelling and accessing valued opportunities and how this may lead to TRSE. Ten different dimensions of TRSE that individuals may experience are suggested. Although some dimensions were already proposed in past work, we contributed to this framework by expanding their scope and proposing a new dimension. The paper concludes that policies aimed at reducing TRSE should be concerned with increasing the capabilities of those in accessibility poverty to a sufficient level that enables individuals' participation in key opportunities of the society. We identified that not every accessibility measure is suitable for assessing TRSE, and the selection of measures must pay attention to their alignment with the idea of accessibility as a human capability. We recommend that conducting an aggregated analysis may be helpful to identify a suitable accessibility measure and to identify regions at risk of TRSE; however, to have a deep understanding of an individual's TRSE risk factors, a bottom-up analysis is necessary.},

This review allowed deriving a general frame for the evaluation of transport projects. One of the conclusions resulted in the importance of integrating stakeholders in the decision process not yet very common in the transport projects that were reviewed.

This paper collates available evidence on the share of immobiles in travel diary surveys.

After analysing both disaggregate and aggregate information, this paper concludes that the share of immobiles should be in the range of 8\%\textendash 12\% for the standard one-day, weekday-only travel diary. The analysis suggests that a substantial share of respondents refuse to participate in a soft way, i.e. by claiming not to have left the house.

A shift from automobiles to transit use among older adults could be enabled through programming and incentives.

In this paper, surveys (n=131) and semi-structured interviews (n=16) were utilized to explore older adults' travel behaviour and experiences related to a recently introduced free transit program in the suburban municipality of Oakville, Ontario, Canada. Results from logistic regression models suggest that older adults with lower incomes, those who drive frequently, and live closer to downtown, were more likely to have benefited from Oakville's free bus program. The common self-reported reasons for using the program related to scheduling, the opportunity for social interaction, financial savings and declining health. Some older adults did not use the program because they perceived using the bus to be inconvenient. The findings from this research advances North American research focusing on the potential impacts of free transit/bus programs on older adults, and may inform age-friendly planning and policy in suburban municipalities.},

  abstract = {How did one of the most historically automobile-dependent US cities end up with the first large-scale modern US bike-sharing system? The story reveals that it is less about transportation demand planning and engineering and more about the principles of what has been termed tactical urbanism. The tactical urbanism movement revolves around the idea that temporary interventions can help one understand what interventions might work in a particular context and lay the foundation for more permanent ones. That the first large-scale bike-sharing system in the US began as such an intervention is quite remarkable and illustrative of the potential of this strategy to build public aspiration and political will via temporary, short-term empirical success. Beginning with preparations for the 2008 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Denver, Colorado, this paper details what went into creating the temporary Freewheel!n bike-share system and how that was able to be leveraged into a permanent bike-sharing system, Denver B-Cycle, two years later. Consistent with the characteristics of tactical urbanism, the partnerships formed with the temporary DNC implementation served as a catalyst. The paper then identifies lessons that other cities can learn and apply in similar large-scale tactical urbanism interventions.},

  abstract = {Transport modeling and cost-benefit analysis are two key tools used in trans- port planning. Both tools have been adapted substantially to cope with the challenges posed by the goal of sustainable development. However, the changes have primarily focused on the negative environmental impacts of the transport sector. Hardly any attention has been paid to another key dimension of sustain- able development: social justice. This paper critically analyzes the two tools from this perspective. It concludes that transport modeling is implicitly based on the distributive principle of demand. Given the importance of mobility in current society, it is suggested to replace current demand-based approaches by transport modeling that is based on the principle of need. Likewise, cost- benefit analysis has a built-in distributive mechanism that structurally favors transport improvements for highly mobile groups. This problem could be solved by replacing travel time savings by so-called accessibility gains as the key benefit taken into account in cost-benefit analysis. If the suggested changes were realized, both transport modeling and cost-benefit analysis could become key tools for promoting sustainable transport.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents a justice perspective to transport and health. It is well understood that the health benefits and burdens related to transport are not distributed evenly over the population. This holds for exposure to transport-related air pollution, for traffic risks, for access to healthy foods, for opportunities for active travel, and so on. Empirical studies often equate disparities with inequalities and inequalities with inequities. These terms, however, have a distinct meaning. The terms differences, disparities, and inequalities are in its essence descriptive terms. The terms inequities and injustices, in turn, imply a normative judgment of these differences. In this chapter, three possible perspectives on justice in health are briefly discussed. It is proposed that the just health framework developed by Norman Daniels is the most suitable perspective for a discussion on transport and health. Daniels argues that a health inequality ``is unjust when it results from an unjust distribution of the socially controllable determinants of population health.'' This perspective clarifies, first, that virtually all transport and health literature focuses on the social determinants of health and, second, that the analysis of the unjust disparities in these social determinants should be an essential part of the literature on justice and health. This chapter continues to explore what an ``unjust distribution'' may mean for three distinct social determinants of health: transport-related air pollution, traffic risk, and opportunities for active travel. This exploration underscores that a justice approach to transport and health goes beyond the mere mapping of disparities and suggests that, in some cases, some level of disparity may well be in line with requirements of justice. This chapter ends with a call on researchers of transport and health to more explicitly engage with notions of justice than is currently the case.},

The goal of this article is to assess the distributive impacts of the widely-used four-step, demand-based, transport model. This article starts from the hypothesis that the consecutive application of the four-step model over a number of years, and successive investments in transport infrastructure consistent with the model results, will widen existing gaps between high-mobile and low-mobile groups, in terms of transport facilities and accessibility available to each group. A simplified four-step model is then developed to test the hypothesis under different policy scenarios. The results are mixed. In each scenario, gaps between high-mobile and low-mobile groups are increasing and decreasing at the same time. Against expectations, the distributive implications of demand-based modelling seem to depend on the situation and the focus of analysis. Given the unpredictable distributive impacts, it is suggested that explicit justice indicators be incorporated in transport modelling if it is to contribute to a more just distribution of transport facilities and accessibility over population groups.},

That distribution, we propose, is one where the maximum gap between the lowest and highest accessibility, both by mode and in space, should be limited, while attempting to maximize average access. We then review transportation planning practice for a priori distributional goals and find little explicit guidance in conventional and even justice-oriented transportation planning and analyses.

The goal of the paper is to provide an overview of the various directions an equity analysis, carried out within the context of a social cost\textendash benefit analysis, could take. The paper starts from the widely-shared definition of distributive justice: the morally proper distribution of goods and bads over members of society. Following this definition, carrying out an equity analysis requires that decisions are made about: (1) the benefits and costs that are distributed through a transport project; (2) the members of society between whom benefits and costs are distributed; and (3) the distributive principle that determines whether a particular distribution is fair. Much of the discussions about cost\textendash benefit analysis and equity do not address these questions in any systematic way. The paper aims to provide a framework. Three sets of benefits and costs are identified as a possible focus of an equity analysis: (1) net benefits; (2) mobility-enhancing benefits; and (3) individual benefits and costs. For each set, a discussion follows regarding the way in which members of societies could be divided into meaningful groups, as well as the possible yardstick for judging whether a certain distribution is fair. While the paper acknowledges that the choice between the three sets is ultimately a political decision, it ends with a set of arguments that suggest that the equity analysis of transport projects should focus first and foremost on the mobility-enhancing benefits generated by such projects.},

This new way of creating floating catchments was developed  to address the change of spatial support problem (COSP) by upscaling the  availability of the service observed at a provider location to the county-level so  that its geographic association with utilization could be measured using the same  spatial support. Medicare Fee-for-Service claims data were used to identify  beneficiaries aged {$\geq$}\,65 years who received outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)  in the Southeastern United States in 2014 (n\,=\,8798), the number of PR treatments  these beneficiaries received (n\,=\,132,508), and the PR providers they chose  (n\,=\,426). The positive correlation between PR availability and utilization was  relatively low, but statistically significant (r\,=\,0.619, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) indicating that  most people use the nearest available PR services, but some travel long distances.  SAFCs can be created using data from health care systems that collect claim-level  utilization data that identifies the locations of providers chosen by beneficiaries  of a specific health care procedure.},

  abstract = {This article proposes an agenda for research into the spatial, social, and relational character of globally circulating urban policies, policy models, and policy knowledge. It draws on geographical political economy literatures that analyze particular social processes in terms of wider sociospatial contexts, in part by maintaining a focus on the dialectics of fixity and flow. The article combines this perspective with poststructuralist arguments about the analytical benefits of close studies of the embodied practices, representations, and expertise through which policy knowledge is mobilized. I suggest that the notion of mobilities offers a useful rubric under which to operationalize this approach to the "local globalness" of urban policy transfer. The utility of this research approach is illustrated by the example of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a city that is frequently referenced by policymakers elsewhere as they look for "hot" policy ideas. The case also indicates that there is much research yet to be done on the character and implications of interurban policy transfer. Specifically, I argue that, while maintaining a focus on wider forces, studies of urban policy mobilities must take seriously the role that apparently banal activities of individual policy transfer agents play in the travels of policy models and must also engage in fine-grained qualitative studies of how policies are carried from place to place, learned in specific settings, and changed as they move. The final section offers theoretical and methodological questions and considerations that can frame future research into how, why, and with what consequences urban policies are mobilized globally. 本文提出了一种议程，可以用于研究全球化运行的城市政策，政策模型和政策知识中有关空间，社会和相互关系的特性。基于那些被用来分析在更广泛的社会空间背景下特定的社会进程的政治经济地理文献，本文部分侧重于固定性和流动性的辩证分析。本文将该观点与后结构主义关于下列因素的效益分析观点结合到一起，即针对具体化实践的详细研究，表述，以及所获得的经验（籍此政策知识得以机动）。作者认为，对``机动性''的定义提供了一个有益的规程，在此规程下，可以规范化运行上述方法，以实现城市政策移植中的``本地化的全球性''。本文介绍了利用这种研究方法的一个例子：位于加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚省的温哥华市，是一个经常被其它地方的决策者引用为他们寻求``热门''政策思路的城市。该案例还表明，关于城市之间城市政策移植性的特点和推论，还有许多研究尚待进行。具体来说，本文认为，在保持对更广泛力量的侧重前提下，研究城市政策的机动性必须认真对待某些个别政策移植机构的作用，他们在政策模型的移植过程中那些明显的平庸作为，同时也必须进行细致的定性研究，研究政策是如何从一个地方移植到另一个地方去的，如何在特定的环境下学习，并且在移植过程中得以改变。文章的最后一节提供了理论和方法方面的问题和思考，籍此可以构架未来的研究，用以分析城市政策全球化移植所产生的如何，为什么，以及什么样的后果问题。 Este art\'iculo propone una agenda de investigaci\'on del car\'acter espacial, social y relacional de las pol\'iticas urbanas que circulan a escala global, de los modelos de pol\'iticas y el conocimiento sobre pol\'iticas. El art\'iculo se apoya en las literaturas de econom\'ia pol\'itica que analizan procesos sociales particulares en t\'erminos de contextos socioespaciales m\'as amplios, conservando en parte enfocada la dial\'ectica de fijeza y flujo. El art\'iculo combina esta perspectiva con argumentos posestructuralistas sobre los beneficios anal\'iticos de estudios cerrados sobre pr\'acticas intr\'insecas, representaciones y experticia, por medio de las cuales se moviliza la pol\'itica del conocimiento. Mi sugerencia es que la noci\'on de movilidades ofrece una \'util r\'ubrica bajo la cual operacionalizar este enfoque para la "globalidad local" de transferencia de pol\'itica urbana. La utilidad de este enfoque de investigaci\'on se ilustra con el ejemplo de Vancouver, Columbia Brit\'anica, Canad\'a, una ciudad que con frecuencia es referida en otras partes por los gestores de pol\'iticas, en tanto andan a la caza de ideas "c\'alidas" sobre el particular. El caso muestra tambi\'en que existe todav\'ia mucho por investigar sobre el car\'acter e implicaciones de la transferencia de pol\'iticas interurbanas. Espec\'ificamente arguyo que, al tiempo que mantienen a la vista el inter\'es por fuerzas de mayor amplitud, los estudios de movilidades de pol\'iticas urbanas deben considerar seriamente el papel que juegan las actividades aparentemenmte banales de los agentes de transferencia de pol\'itica individual en los desplazamientos de los modelos de pol\'iticas, y deben tambi\'en comprometerse en estudios cualitativos de grano fino sobre la manera como se mueven las pol\'iticas de lugar en lugar, aprendidas en escenarios espec\'ificos, y transformadas a medida que son movilizadas. La secci\'on final formula interrogantes te\'oricos y metodol\'ogicos y consideraciones que pueden ayudar a enmarcar investigaciones futuras alrededor del c\'omo, por qu\'e y con qu\'e consecuencias se movilizan globalmente las pol\'iticas urbanas.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study assesses the prevalence of poor self-rated health and investigates its association with individual and environmental characteristics in adults with and without reported morbidity. A household survey assessed 4,048 adults in two districts of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. We used Poisson regression with robust variance stratified by the presence of reported morbidity. Prevalence of poor self-rated health was 29.9\% (42.6\% in those with morbidity and 13.1\% in the group without morbidity). All assessed domains were associated with self-rated health in subjects with reported morbidity. In the group without reported morbidity, the following were associated with self-rated health: social environment, socio-demographic factors, lifestyle, and psychological health. Perceived problems in the environment were associated with poor self-rated health in both groups, even after hierarchical adjustment. The results suggest the importance of investigating self-rated health stratified by reported morbidity and reinforce the need to include variables that characterize the physical and social environment.},

I examine two distinct geographic scales: census-defined ?places?, and synthetically constructed ?centered communities?. Centered communities are defined as nonwork travel sheds centered upon well-defined concentrations of activity. Higher accessibility share (a new urban form measure defined in the paper) and higher mixed use both significantly predict greater community completeness, as do higher levels of residential or employment density. Furthermore, I find that mixed-use measures describe something other than simple proximity to job-based attractions; these measures also address the appropriate balance of activities necessary for a complete community. To build more-complete communities, planners need to ensure that local accessibility to a variety of destinations of interest is high relative to the regional accessibility to these same types of destinations outside the community.},

We find mixed results. For one of the four fare changes the decline in ridership is greater in lower-income neighborhoods than it is in higher-income neighborhoods. However, the reverse is found for another fare increase. For two of the increases there is no relationship between income and ridership response. These mixed findings are in line with the prior literature that also found an inconsistent relationship. We hypothesize that there are two competing forces at work. On one hand lower-income groups are more constrained in their budget, but on the other hand they have fewer options for switching to other modes.},

Healthcare restructuring initiatives seldom take into consideration the complexity of transportation, which acts as a barrier to appropriate and timely access to healthcare services for older adults in rural communities. This article presents findings of a qualitative research study that explored the complex nature of transportation challenges that rural-dwelling older adults experience in Western Canada when trying to access primary and community care services. Data were derived from a larger study of service user views on a healthcare restructuring initiative intended to facilitate aging-in-place. We conducted 15 focus groups and 9 interviews with a diverse sample of 83 older adults living in one urban centre and nine rural and small rural towns in British Columbia (BC)'s interior. We used content analysis to determine codes and derive themes. Study findings showed that transportation was a top priority for improving primary and community care. Older adult participants identified a range of transportation challenges in trying to get to healthcare services and care providers getting to them. Transportation was a social determinant of health (SDOH) for all participants, regardless of whether they lived in the urban centre or in a rural or small rural town. Our study provides more evidence to support that transportation is a key SDOH for rural-dwelling older adults. As such, transportation should be specifically addressed in healthcare restructuring initiatives that aim to support aging-in-place. Service providers need to advocate for system-wide solutions such as integrating transportation into the healthcare system, while it is imperative that decision-makers act on these solutions.},

The human development model highlights in relation to wellbeing the roles of resources, conversion functions, agency, and it uses capabilities and/or functionings as metric for wellbeing. It does not consider impairments/health conditions as individual characteristics; instead, they are themselves determined by resources, structural factors, and personal characteristics, and thus the model is informed by the socioeconomic determinants of health literature.

Older adults who lived in either conventional residential or condominium neighbourhoods discussed poor traffic conditions and lack of benches/trees/places as barriers, and proximity to parks and access to shops as enablers to walking. Poor sidewalk quality, absence of street lights and personal safety concerns were major barriers to walking only for those living in suburban residential neighbourhoods. Our results indicate that high quality- and safe walking infrastructure may facilitate walking for physical activity among older adults living in the suburban communities.},

This study evaluated the effect of self-reported 1-way travel time to hemodialysis on mortality, health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), adherence, withdrawal from dialysis therapy, hospitalization, and transplantation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort. SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practices Patterns Study who completed a patient questionnaire (n = 20,994). PREDICTOR: One-way travel time to hemodialysis treatment, categorized as 15 or less, 16 to 30, 31 to 60, and longer than 60 minutes. Covariates included demographics, comorbid conditions, serum albumin level, time on dialysis therapy, and country. OUTCOME \& MEASUREMENT: HR-QOL was examined by using a linear mixed model. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine associations with mortality, withdrawal from dialysis therapy, hospitalization, and transplantation. RESULTS: Longer travel time was associated with greater adjusted relative risk (RR) of death (P = 0.05 for overall trend). Adjusted HR-QOL subscales were significantly lower for those with longer travel times compared with those traveling 15 minutes or less. There were no associations of travel time with withdrawal from dialysis therapy (P = 0.6), hospitalization (P = 0.4), or transplantation (P = 0.7). LIMITATIONS: The questionnaire nonresponse rate was substantial, and nonresponders were older, with more comorbid conditions. Travel time was assessed by using a single nonvalidated question. CONCLUSIONS: Longer travel time is associated significantly with greater mortality risk and decreased HR-QOL. Exploring opportunities to decrease travel time should be incorporated into the dialysis clinical routine.},

Accordingly, one main purpose of this paper is to introduce a larger share of the community to some fundamental SWB-related concepts and their application in transportation research, with the goal of attracting others to this rewarding area of study. At the same time, however, I also hope to offer some useful reflections to those already working in this field. After discussing some basic issues of terminology and measurement of SWB, I present from the literature four conceptual models relating travel and subjective well-being. Following one of those models, I review five ways in which travel can influence well-being. I conclude by examining some challenges associated with assessing the impacts of travel on well-being, as well as challenges associated with applying what we learn to policy.},

This research expands on previous research on the perceived pleasantness of built environments by presenting a large-scale case study of the urban layout pleasantness in the central area of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, a typical global south city, and correlating pleasantness scores with socioeconomic factors to understand whether people do in fact live where the urban layout is more pleasant and how pleasantness and socioeconomic factors relate and contribute to one's choice of living location. A comparison with the city of Coimbra, Portugal, representative of the global north, was also carried out. The findings showed that pleasantness tended to correlate negatively with urban density and positively with income. Possible explanations for these results and their generality are advanced.},

Data obtained for three large urban centers \textendash{} Hamilton, Toronto, and Montreal \textendash{} are analyzed using spatial expansion models, a technique used to obtain spatially-varying coefficients that help to tease out contextual person-location variations in travel behavior. Detailed geographical results help to enhance our understanding of the spatiality of travel behavior of the population segments of interest. Substantively, the results provide evidence of significant interactions between location, various demographic factors, and mobility tools. More specifically, the results evince patterns of mobility that are significantly different from the mainstream population, particularly in suburban settings, in ways that are indicative of mobility challenges.},

  abstract = {How and why travel contributes to our life satisfaction is of considerable import for transportation policy and planning. This paper empirically examines this relationship using data from the American Time Use Survey. It finds that, controlling for relevant demographic, geographic, and temporal covariates, travel time per day is significantly and positively associated with life satisfaction. This relationship is attenuated, but still significant, when the amount of time spent participating in out-of-home activities is controlled for. Time spent bicycling is strongly associated with higher life satisfaction, though it attains significance only in some models; time spent walking is also quite positive, though it is not significant. However, both walking and bicycling are positively and significantly associated with life satisfaction when time spent on purely recreational walking and bicycling is included. Life satisfaction is positively and significantly associated with time spent traveling for the purposes of eating and drinking, religious activities, volunteering, and playing and watching sports. Travel time exhibits a strong positive relationship with life satisfaction in smaller towns and cities, but in large cities the association weakens, and for very large cities travel time may actually not be associated with life satisfaction at all. This may be due to the costs of traffic congestion, which disproportionately exists in large cities. In all, while the associations between travel and life satisfaction are clear, the causal story is complex, with the positive relationships potentially being explained by (1) travel allowing us to access destinations that make us happy, (2) the act of travel itself being fulfilling, and/or (3) intrinsically happier people being more likely to travel. In all likelihood, all three factors are at play.},

  abstract = {Background: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is being spread at an unprecedented rate across the globe. Yet, new research suggests that digital divide is not only continuing but also deepening at the same time. After access to basic ICT equipment, it is now the lack of skills and quality of hardware and software that leads to a continuing digital divide. Digital divide which is specifically related to elderly is known as grey digital divide. Objectives: The focus of this paper is to review and analyze recent relevant research on grey digital divide which is fast emerging as a major challenge in the era of ageing. A side objective is to raise implications for theory and practice discourses to minimize grey digital divide. Method: Literature on digital divide and grey digital divide is reviewed to gather relevant knowledge on the grey digital divide. The articles were filtered according to the relevance for grey digital divide in the present age. Literature review spanned over a 5~years? timeline to discuss the current trends on the topic. Results: Results indicate a rising problem of ageing, mainly in developed countries. Grey digital divide constitutes a major challenge for elderly to participate and benefit from the digital revolution. Elderly face problems for basic tasks such as booking tickets or renewing bus cards to claiming old-age benefits because most of the systems are digitized. Another challenge is the social exclusion faced by elderly because they cannot connect with peers through digital networks due to lack of digital skills. This situation is also observed in developing countries, although in developing countries elderly get immediate help from family members due to the family system of joint living. Implications and future directions: A practical implication of this research can be a full-scale fieldwork in different countries of the world to further understand the grey digital divide. Joint collaboration between ICT and healthcare industry may result in revolutionizing of ergonomic ICT products and services which are elderly-friendly. It would be interesting to know how culture impacts grey digital divide across various countries.},

This article reports research carried out to identify the role of mobility and accessibility in older people's self-reported quality of life, through an in-depth examination of older people's travel needs. A wholly qualitative approach, utilising a variety of data collection methods including focus groups, interviews and diary completion, was employed with 57 people aged over 65 in the UK, of which 26 were drivers and 31 had recently given up driving. The findings emphasise the importance of mobility for accessing services and shops. However, the reasons why older people travel and the importance of mobility go beyond accessibility to include the desire for independence, control, maintaining status, inclusion, `normalness' and travel for its own sake. All these are related to an individual's perception of quality of life. When older people give up driving, their self-reported quality of life is reduced and this seems very much related to a reduction in affective and aesthetic qualities of mobility that a car affords that walking and using public transport lack. It is suggested that policy and practice needs to consider such motives for travel.},

  abstract = {The literature on relationships between the built environment and travel is extensive, but the vast majority of such studies relies solely on statistical analyses of travel survey data, with limited possibilities for establishing causality. This article presents insights from in-depth qualitative research, offering stronger evidence of causal influences than in mainstream studies on the built environment and travel. Analyzing 33 qualitative interviews, the paper explains causal mechanisms underlying differences between inner-city and suburban residents' travel behavior observed in the Norwegian metropolitan areas of Oslo and Stavanger and in several earlier studies. We argue that built environment characteristics influence travel through their interplay with inhabitants' rationales for location of activities and travel mode choice. The interviewees' main rationales for activity locations, choosing the best facility and minimizing the friction of distance, are often traded off against each other. Inner-city residents can still be selective about the quality of the facility without needing to travel a long distance, since many potential facilities are often available within short distance from the dwelling. For suburbanites, choosing the best facility more often requires acceptance of longer travel distances. This is still context-dependent, depending on the center structure of the city. The interviewees' rationales for travel mode choice are, together with time-geographical constraints, an important part of the explanation why suburbanites tend to travel much more frequently by car than inner-city residents do. Those who need to overcome long distances to reach daily destinations need fast means of transportation, and therefore consider themselves more car-dependent. The similarity of the transport rationales found in this study with rationales identified in other studies in different city contexts suggests a high degree of generality in the basic mechanisms through which urban form influences travel behavior.},

Homeowners, who are organized, repeat players in local politics, mobilize against proposed projects nearby, while renters, who would benefit from more housing, benefit too diffusely to mobilize for it and may not even vote in the jurisdiction. Using data from two nationally representative surveys of urban and suburban residents, we posit a further cause of the housing shortage: public misunderstanding of housing markets. Through vignettes describing a 10\% shock to regional housing supply, we find that only about 30\textendash 40\% of respondents believe that additional supply would reduce prices and rents. Using a conjoint design, we find that this ``Supply Skepticism'' is robust to question wording, stipulated counterfactual assumptions, and the cause of the supply shock. It also appears to be specific to housing: respondents generally gave correct answers to questions about supply shocks in other markets. Finally, we find that while nearly all renters and even a majority of homeowners say they would prefer home prices and rents in their city to be lower in the future, support for state preemption of local land-use restrictions depends on beliefs about housing markets. ``Supply skepticism'' among renters undermines their support for home construction, while some homeowners appear to be more supportive of new development than they would be if they held conventional economic views.},

We reinterpret the historical geography of twentieth century LGBT lives and the associated `rise and fall' of gay enclaves through the lens of the `politics of mobility'. In this reading, it is apparent that multifaceted movements \textemdash{} migration, physical and social mobility, and motility \textemdash{} underpin the formation of gay enclaves and recent transformations in sexual and gendered landscapes. After the second world war, LGBT communities in the global North were embedded in specific historical geographies of mobility and we trace these in the Canadian and Australian contexts. The `great gay migration' from the 1960s to the 1980s has been joined by new LGBT constellations of mobility in the 2000s, and these have imprinted upon the sexual and gendered landscapes of Toronto and Sydney.},

However, do neighbourhoods matter for neighbourhood satisfaction? This study answers that question using a meta-analysis to pool 126 estimates from 27 studies of the association between neighbourhoods and neighbourhood satisfaction. I find that neighbourhoods do matter for neighbourhood satisfaction, but that their direct effect is weak. I consider several possible explanations for this finding, and discuss the practical significance of calling into question whether changes to a neighbourhood's built or social environment can meaningfully improve residents' neighbourhood satisfaction.},

This paper critically reviews the latest methodological and empirical research developments and trends in this area through a transport geography lens. More specifically, this paper discusses recent accomplishments in terms of modeling accessibility and provides a systematic and comprehensive literature review of their application in empirical studies of health care delivery. Based on this literature review a research agenda is put forward, identifying knowledge gaps that transport researchers can help to fill. These knowledge gaps pertain to the need for more spatially disaggregated, individualized and temporally-aware accessibility metrics, more sophisticated geocomputational tools to operationalize such metrics and improved measurement of equity considerations in empirical research.},

  abstract = {Disparity in spatial accessibility is strongly associated with growing inequalities among urban communities. Since improving levels of accessibility for certain communities can provide them with upward social mobility and address social exclusion and inequalities in cities, it is important to understand the nature and distribution of spatial accessibility among urban communities. To support decision-makers in achieving inclusion and fairness in policy interventions in cities, we present an open and data-driven framework to understand the spatial nature of accessibility to infrastructure among the different demographics. We find that accessibility to a wide range of infrastructure in any city (54 cities) converges to a Zipf's law, suggesting that inequalities also appear proportional to growth processes in these cities. Then, assessing spatial inequalities among the socioeconomically clustered urban profiles for 10 of those cities, we find urban communities are distinctly segregated along social and spatial lines. We find low accessibility scores for populations who have a larger share of minorities, earn less and have a relatively lower number of individuals with a university degree. These findings suggest that the reproducible framework we propose may be instrumental in understanding processes leading to spatial inequalities and in supporting cities to devise targeted measures for addressing inequalities for certain underprivileged communities.},

  abstract = {Introduction Urban and transport planning have large impacts on public health, but these are generally not explicitly considered and/or quantified, partly because there are no comprehensive models, methods and tools readily available. Air pollution, noise, temperature, green space, motor vehicle crashes and physical activity are important pathways linking urban and transport planning and public health. For policy decision-making, it is important to understand and be able to quantify the full-chain from source through pathways to health effects and impacts to substantiate and effectively target actions. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of recent studies on the health impacts related to urban and transport planning in cities, describe the need for novel participatory quantitative health impact assessments (HIA) and provide recommendations. Method To devise our searches and narrative, we were guided by a recent conceptual framework linking urban and transport planning, environmental exposures, behaviour and health. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and references from relevant articles in English language from January 1, 1980, to November 1, 2016, using pre-defined search terms. Results The number of HIA studies is increasing rapidly, but there is lack of participatory integrated and full-chain HIA models, methods and tools. These should be based on the use of a systemic multidisciplinary/multisectorial approach and state-of-the-art methods to address questions such as what are the best, most feasible and needed urban and transport planning policy measures to improve public health in cities? Active citizen support and new forms of communication between experts and citizens and the involvement of all major stakeholders are crucial to find and successfully implement health promoting policy measures. Conclusion We provided an overview of the current state-of-the art of HIA in cities and made recommendations for further work. The process on how to get there is as important and will provide answers to many crucial questions on e.g. how different disciplines can effectively work together, how to incorporate citizen and stakeholder opinion into quantitative HIA modelling for urban and transport planning, how different modelling and measurement methods can be effectively integrated, and whether a public health approach can bring about positive changes in urban and transport planning.},

Participants had a distance sensor and two video cameras fitted to their bicycle for two weeks while they cycled on their usual routes, producing 46,769 events where a motor vehicle passed a bicycle. This was the largest study to-date to record passing behavior on public roads, and a large number of road and traffic attributes that might affect passing distance were included in the analysis. When drivers pass cyclists on roads with painted bicycle lanes, they tend to give more space than on roads without bicycle lanes. This is true even when controlling for the space available on the roadway. Drivers also travel in a more predictable fashion, with less variability in passing distances when a bicycle lane is present. Protected bicycle lanes completely remove the risk of passing events less than 1\,m. However, where it is not possible to build a protected bicycle lane it is preferable to have a painted bicycle lane than no bicycle lane at all. Other protective factors include: wider lanes, single lane roads, smaller vehicles, and the removal of on-street parking.},

Using ballot names of council candidates in thousands of local elections in Brazil to accurately classify law-and-order candidates, it shows that the election of police law-and-order candidates causes more homicides. Moreover, georeferenced data on police activity and homicides show neglect in areas that did not support a winning police law-and-order candidate, despite these areas being home to the majority of individuals vulnerable to violence. This favoritism, however, is not present in places where preexisting local institutions make policing more transparent. Instead of persecution directed against minorities or the incapacity to battle criminal gangs, this research shows that surges in violence can be the result of typical forms of democratic representation.},

Various explanations have been suggested. In this article, we show that the rising residential population in the Central Area has served to reduce inbound commuting trips below what they otherwise would be. For reasons discussed in the article, it is normally difficult to quantify the effect on commuting of downtown housing growth or population intensification. By recognizing these difficulties and testing our results in various ways, we have been able to estimate that, on average since 1976, for each 100 additional dwelling units in the Central Area there has been a reduction of approximately 120 inbound trips during the morning three-hour rush period. This finding indicates the potential for the use of housing policy as a land-use planning instrument, one that could help mediate the conflict between continued commercial office growth downtown and the desire to preserve the quality of the downtown residential environment, which is threatened by the construction of major new commuting facilities, particularly roads, to serve that office growth.},

Among other things, this will entail devoting more attention to the evaluation of upstream intervention strategies. However, merely increasing the supply of such studies is not enough. The pivotal link between research and policy or practice should be the cumulation of insight from multiple studies. If conventional evidence synthesis can be thought of as analogous to building a wall, then we can increase the supply of bricks (the number of studies), their similarity (statistical commensurability) or the strength of the mortar (the statistical methods for holding them together). However, many contemporary public health challenges seem akin to herding sheep in mountainous terrain, where ordinary walls are of limited use and a more flexible way of combining dissimilar stones (pieces of evidence) may be required. This would entail shifting towards generalising the functions of interventions, rather than their effects; towards inference to the best explanation, rather than relying on binary hypothesis-testing; and towards embracing divergent findings, to be resolved by testing theories across a cumulated body of work. In this way we might channel a spirit of pragmatic pluralism into making sense of complex sets of evidence, robust enough to support more plausible causal inference to guide action, while accepting and adapting to the reality of the public health landscape rather than wishing it were otherwise. The traditional art of dry stone walling can serve as a metaphor for the more 'holistic sense-making' we propose.},

  abstract = {Despite smaller effect sizes, interventions delivered at population level to prevent non-communicable diseases generally have greater reach, impact and equity than those delivered to high-risk groups. Nevertheless, how to shift population behaviour patterns in this way remains one of the greatest uncertainties for research and policy. Evidence about behaviour change interventions that are easier to evaluate tends to overshadow that for population-wide and system-wide approaches that generate and sustain healthier behaviours. Population health interventions are often implemented as natural experiments, which makes their evaluation more complex and unpredictable than a typical randomised controlled trial (RCT). We discuss the growing importance of evaluating natural experiments and their distinctive contribution to the evidence for public health policy. We contrast the established evidence-based practice pathway, in which RCTs generate `definitive' evidence for particular interventions, with a practice-based evidence pathway in which evaluation can help adjust the compass bearing of existing policy. We propose that intervention studies should focus on reducing critical uncertainties, that non-randomised study designs should be embraced rather than tolerated and that a more nuanced approach to appraising the utility of diverse types of evidence is required. The complex evidence needed to guide public health action is not necessarily the same as that which is needed to provide an unbiased effect size estimate. The practice-based evidence pathway is neither inferior nor merely the best available when all else fails. It is often the only way to generate meaningful evidence to address critical questions about investing in population health interventions.},

One simulation study suggested scenarios in which the 10 EPV rule can be relaxed. The effect of a range of binary predictors with varying prevalence, reflecting clinical practice, has not yet been fully investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted an extended resampling study using a large general-practice data set, comprising over 2 million anonymized patient records, to examine the EPV requirements for prediction models with low-prevalence binary predictors developed using Cox regression. The performance of the models was then evaluated using an independent external validation data set. We investigated both fully specified models and models derived using variable selection. RESULTS: Our results indicated that an EPV rule of thumb should be data driven and that EPV {$\geq$} 20 \hspace{0pt} generally eliminates bias in regression coefficients when many low-prevalence predictors are included in a Cox model. CONCLUSION: Higher EPV is needed when low-prevalence predictors are present in a model to eliminate bias in regression coefficients and improve predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a research study that investigated the travel behaviour of residents in three case study station precincts located along a new railway in Perth, Western Australia. The precincts were selected for comparison, representing the different development opportunities ranging from planned transit-oriented development (TOD) to station precincts acting primarily as origin stations or transit interchanges. Accessibility measures and the actual travel patterns of residents in each station precinct were compared, in order to consider the degree to which different station precinct designs have led residents to reduce their motorised travel and to substitute it with both public transport within the region, and walking or cycling within the local neighbourhood. We draw on two surveys: a household survey, including a travel diary, examining behaviours after the railway opened; a detailed survey measuring both local and regional accessibility using a suite of over 30 measures of multi-modal accessibility. The results highlight the dual role of public transport and land\textemdash use planning in changing mobility patterns, using a temporal perspective. We found a positive relationship between improvements to accessibility by public transport and residents reducing car-based travel. Residents also increased the spatial reach of their travel and many converted from uni-modal to multi-modal travellers. At the local level (station precinct), however, we found an accessibility mismatch between infrastructure and proximity to facilities, whereby neighbourhoods with a high standard of infrastructure for walking and cycling do not have corresponding facilities that they may walk or cycle to and vice versa.},

Combining administrative data on welfare recipients and employment in Los Angeles with data from the 1990 decennial census, we show that greater access to local jobs in low-wage firms increases the likelihood that welfare recipients find employment in neighborhood jobs. Moreover, welfare recipients who have long commutes earn less than those who find work closer to home, contrary to the pattern for most workers. These findings demonstrate that proximity to low-wage jobs benefits welfare recipients through reduced commuting expenses and increased earnings.},

We develop statistical models to test for gender differences in the perception of safety and satisfaction on urban metros and buses by using large-scale unique customer satisfaction data for 28 world cities over the period 2009\textendash 2018. Results indicate a significant gender gap in the perception of safety, with women being 10\% more likely than men to feel unsafe in metros (6\% for buses). This gender gap is larger for safety than for overall satisfaction (3\% in metros and 2.5\% in buses), which is consistent with safety being one dimension of overall satisfaction. Results are stable across specifications and robust to inclusion of city level and time controls. We find heterogeneous responses by sociodemographic characteristics. Data indicate that 45\% of women feel secure in trains and metro stations (and 55\% in buses). Thus the gender gap encompasses more differences in transport perception between men and women rather than an intrinsic network fear. Additional models test for the influence of metro characteristics on perceived safety levels and find that more acts of violence, larger carriages and emptier vehicles decrease women's feeling of safety.},

  abstract = {Accessibility is a widely used concept in transportation planning and research. However a majority of the literature is concerned with accessibility in infrastructure-rich regions where it is used to assess the output of infrastructure. Relatively scant attention in contrast has been paid to the topic of accessibility in infrastructure-poor regions. These are regions characterized by non-homogeneous landscapes with limited or no transportation infrastructure. Even studies that deal with infrastructure-poor regions tend to transpose the methods used elsewhere. This practice seems inappropriate when mobility happens by active rather than motorized modes since the effort required for movement is likely different. The objective of this paper is to compare distance, time, and metabolic energy cost functions in walking accessibility. To this end, we present a case study of accessibility to water in central Kenya. The results indicate that Euclidean distance, surface distance, and travel time correlate better between them than any of them does with metabolic energy. Furthermore, while shortest paths tend to be symmetric for distance and time criteria, under consideration of metabolic energy expenditure pathways change significantly depending on the direction of movement. This has implications for measuring accessibility and equity. By providing alternate mechanisms for valuing the cost of movement, this research suggests avenues to consider vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women who require greater nutritional intake and expend more energy per unit activity. Directions for further research include certain trade-offs between route choice variables across various applications, for example, walking and cycling route choice algorithms.},

  abstract = {Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methods are a popular tool to investigate accessibility to public facilities, in particular health care services. FCA approaches are attractive because, unlike other accessibility measures, they take into account the potential for congestion of facilities. This is done by 1) considering the population within the catchment area of a facility to calculate a variable that measures level of service, and then 2) aggregating the level of service by population centers subject to catchment area constraints. In this paper we discuss an effect of FCA approaches, an artifact that we term demand and level of service inflation. These artifacts are present in previous implementations of FCA methods. We argue that inflation makes interpretation of estimates of accessibility difficult, which has possible deleterious consequences for decision making. Next, we propose a simple and intuitive approach to proportionally allocate demandand and level of service in FCA calculations. The approach is based on a standardization of the impedance matrix, similar to approaches popular in the spatial statistics and econometrics literature. The result is a more intiuitive measure of accessibility that 1) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio; and 2) preserves the level of demand and the level of supply in a system. We illustrate the relevant issues with some examples, and then empirically by means of a case study of accessibility to family physicians in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that demand and supply inflation/deflation affect the interpretation of accessibility analysis using existing FCA methods, and that the proposed adjustment can lead to more intuitive results.}

The case study is the Hamilton Metropolitan Area-an important functional component of Greater Toronto, itself one of the regions in Canada where the impact of ageing is expected to be most strongly felt. Using data from Toronto's Transport Tomorrow Survey and mixed ordered probit models, the study investigates the question of spatial and demographic variability in trip-making behaviour. The results support the proposition that trip-making propensity decreases with age. However, it is also found that this behaviour is not spatially homogeneous and in fact exhibits a large degree of variability-a finding that highlights both the challenges of planning transport for the elderly and the potential of spatial analytical approaches to improve transport modelling practice.},

The case study is McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and data was obtained by means of a web-based survey that included questions regarding travel behavior, socio-demographic information, and attitudes toward travel, land use, and the environment. The objective variable is defined as the ratio of ideal to actual commute time, and regression analysis is implemented to test the relationship between this variable and socio-demographic variables and attitudinal scores. The impact of different attitudes on the gap between ideal and actual commute time is expanded to include three different modes, active travel (walk/cycle), transit, and personal automobile. Interestingly, the results indicate that active travelers tend to be less dissatisfied with their commute, followed by those who travel in a personal vehicle and transit users. A number of attitudinal responses are shown to impact the desire to travel more or less, including variables that relate to the social environment, availability of local activities, quality of facilities, productive use of the commute, and the intrinsic value found in the commute travel. The picture emerges of a traveler who would like to spend more time commuting, as someone who is an active traveler, thinks that getting there is half the fun, dislikes traveling alone, but rather likes to live in an active neighborhood where there is a sense of community. The results suggests that enjoyment of commuting, while a challenge from the perspective of motorized mobility, may provide valuable policy opportunities from the perspective of active transportation.},

Multivariate, spatially expanded models produce estimates of distance travelled that are specific to both geographical location and type of individual. Opportunity landscapes obtained based on these estimates are used for comparative accessibility analysis by means of what are termed relative accessibility deprivation indicators. The indicators proposed are demonstrated with a case study of food deserts in the city of Montreal, Canada. The results of the analysis illustrate the variations in accessibility between individuals in low-income households and the reference group, and the effect of vehicle ownership for accessibility to food services, thus highlighting the social exclusion implications of these factors.}

Extensive numerical experiments are used to investigate situations where the underlying process is stationary and nonstationary, and to assess the degree to which spurious intercoefficient correlations are introduced. Two different implementations of GWR and cross-validation approaches are assessed. Results suggest that judicious application of GWR can be used to discern whether the underlying process is nonstationary. Furthermore, evidence of spurious correlations indicates that caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding spatial relationships retrieved using this approach, particularly when working with small samples.}

Methods We draw upon a panel survey of pre-pandemic transit riders in Vancouver and Toronto. We conduct multivariable two-step tobit regression models that predict the likelihood of a respondent using transit as their primary mode for getting groceries before the pandemic (step 1) and then during the pandemic (step 2). Models are conducted for two survey waves, May 2020 and March 2021. We also conduct zero-inflated negative binomial regression models predicting the frequency respondents ordered groceries online. Results Transit riders over the age of 64 were more likely to use transit to reach groceries before the pandemic and more likely to continue to do so during the pandemic (wave 1, OR, 1.63; CI, 1.24\textendash 2.14; wave 2, OR, 1.35; CI, 1.03\textendash 1.76). Essential workers were more likely to continue using transit to reach groceries during the pandemic (wave 1, OR, 1.33; CI, 1.24\textendash 1.43; wave 2, OR, 1.18; CI, 1.06\textendash 1.32). Walking distance to the nearest grocery store was positively associated with using transit to get groceries pre-pandemic (wave 1, OR, 1.02; CI, 1.01\textendash 1.03; wave 2, OR, 1.02; CI, 1.01\textendash 1.03), and in May 2020 (wave 1, OR 1.01; (1.00\textendash 1.02). During the pandemic, people who stopped using transit to get groceries were less likely to have made zero online grocery purchases (wave 1, OR, 0.56; CI, 0.41\textendash 0.75; wave 2, OR, 0.62; CI, 0.41\textendash 0.94). Discussion People still physically commuting to work were more likely to still use transit to get groceries. Among transit riders, older adults and those living far walking distances from grocery stores are more likely to use transit to get groceries. Older transit riders and those with higher incomes were also more likely to use grocery delivery services, while female, Black, and immigrant riders were less likely to do so.},

However, researchers have underexamined how spatial accessibility studies benefitted from the recently enhanced availability of dynamic variables, such as various travel times via different transportation modes and the finer temporal granularity of geospatial data in these studies. Therefore, in our review, we investigated methodological advancements in place-based accessibility measures and scrutinized two recent trends in spatial accessibility studies: multimodal spatial accessibility and temporal changes in spatial accessibility. Based on the critical review, we propose two research agendas: improving the accuracy of measurements with dynamic variable implementation and furnishing policy implications granted from the enhanced accuracy. These agendas particularly call for the action of geographers on the full implementation of dynamic variables and the strong linkage between accessibility and policymaking.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent work in a number of countries has identified growing geographical inequalities in health between deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods. The health gaps observed cannot be entirely explained by differences in the characteristics of individuals living in those neighbourhoods, which has led to a concerted international public health research effort to determine what contextual features of neighbourhoods matter. This article reports on access to potentially health-promoting community resources across all neighbourhoods in New Zealand. Prevailing international opinion is that access to community resources is worse in deprived neighbourhoods. METHODS: Geographical Information Systems were used to calculate geographical access to 16 types of community resources (including recreational amenities, and shopping, educational and health facilities) in 38,350 small census areas across the country. The distribution of these access measures by neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation was determined. RESULTS: For 15 out of 16 measures of community resources, access was clearly better in more deprived neighbourhoods. For example, the travel time to large supermarkets was approximately 80\% greater in the least deprived quintile of neighbourhoods compared with the most deprived quintile. CONCLUSIONS: These results challenge the widely held, but largely untested, view that areas of high social disadvantage have poorer access to community resources. Poor locational access to community resources among deprived neighbourhoods in New Zealand does not appear to be an explanation of poorer health in these neighbourhoods. If anything, a pro-equity distribution of community resources may be preventing even wider disparities in neighbourhood inequalities in health.},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called ``causal effects'' or ``policy evaluation'') (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of ``regret,'' ``attribution'' or ``causes of effects'') and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as ``mediation''). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

The simulations were based on data from a cardiac trial of 673 patients in which 252 deaths occurred and seven variables were cogent predictors of mortality; the number of events per predictive variable was (2527 = 36) for the full sample. For the simulations, at values of EPV = 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25, we randomly generated 500 samples of the 673 patients, chosen with replacement, according to a logistic model derived from the full sample. Simulation results for the regression coefficients for each variable in each group of 500 samples were compared for bias, precision, and significance testing against the results of the model fitted to the original sample. For EPV values of 10 or greater, no major problems occurred. For EPV values less than 10, however, the regression coefficients were biased in both positive and negative directions; the large sample variance estimates from the logistic model both overestimated and underestimated the sample variance of the regression coeffi-cients; the 90\% confidence limits about the estimated values did not have proper coverage; the Wald statistic was conservative under the null hypothesis; and paradoxical associations (significance in the wrong direction) were increased. Although other factors (such as the total number of events, or sample size) may influence the validity of the logistic model, our findings indicate that low EPV can lead to major problems.},

  abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals' response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.},

Data collected by the OECD shows that most OECD countries provide considerable support to promote access to homeownership: reported spending can amount up to 2.3\% of GDP. Most OECD countries also support the provision of social rental housing, but public support for social rental housing is declining in many countries and the private rental sector is playing an increasingly important role in promoting access to affordable housing. In almost all OECD countries housing support is also delivered through means-tested housing allowances, for which reporting countries spend between 0.6 and 1.8\% of GDP. The available data do not allow for a comprehensive cross-country comparison of the housing policy mix but, where available, data suggest that owner-occupied housing receives significant support compared to other tenures.Access to housing and housing quality also remain pressing concerns in many OECD countries. Significant numbers of people are homeless: while statistics are difficult to compare, most OECD countries report that 1 to 8 people in every thousand lack regular access to housing. In addition, many households live in low-quality dwellings: 15\% of low-income households live in overcrowded dwellings and 14\% do not have access to an indoor flushing toilet. Neighbourhood crime and pollution are also problematic for many households throughout the OECD.},

  abstract = {Contextual poverty refers to high proportions of people with a low income in a certain (residential) space, and it can affect individual socioeconomic outcomes as well as decisions to move into or out of the neighbourhood. Contextual poverty is a multiscale phenomenon: Poverty levels at the regional scale reflect regional economic development, while meso-scale concentrations of poverty within cities are related to city-specific social, economic and housing characteristics. Within cities, poverty can also concentrate at micro spatial scales, which are often neglected, largely due to a lack of data. Exposure to poverty at lower spatial scales, such as housing blocks and streets, is important because it can influence individuals through social mechanisms such as role models or social networks. This paper is based on the premise that sociospatial context is necessarily multiscalar, and therefore contextual poverty is a multiscale problem which can be better understood through the inequality within and between places at different spatial scales. The question is how to compare different spatial contexts if we know that they include various spatial scales. Our measure of contextual poverty embraces 101 spatial scales and compares different locations within and between municipalities in the Netherlands. We found that the national inequality primarily came from the concentrations of poverty in areas of a few kilometres, located in cities, which have different spatial patterns of contextual poverty, such as multicentre, core-periphery and east\textendash west. In addition to the inequality between municipalities, there are considerable within-municipality inequalities, particularly among micro-areas of a few hundred metres.}

Whether post-suburbia can also be delimited in terms of its distinctive politics is the open question explored here.

The paper stresses the structural properties of capitalism that generate differences within the unity of the urbanisation process. It then discusses what is new about a class of postsuburban settlements, concentrating on what the increasing economic gravity of post-suburbia, the difficulty of bounding post-suburban communities and the continuing role of the state imply for understanding urban politics and the reformulation of urban political theory.},

Self-reporting and physical performance measures were derived from the data basis of the FIBRA Study, which investigated frailty and associated variables in a cross-sectional sample of 2164 subjects aged 65 and above, randomly selected in seven Brazilian cities. A model considering satisfaction as a dependent variable, the number of diseases, frailty, cognitive status and depressive symptoms as predictors and self-rated health as a mediating variable was tested through path analysis. The model fit the data well and explained 19\% of life satisfaction's variance. According to the bootstrapping method, indirect effects were significant for all trajectories, suggesting that self-rated health is a mediator variable between physical and mental health and elderl\'ys life satisfaction. In conclusion, adverse conditions of physical and mental health can influence the elderl\'ys life satisfaction, mostly when they determine a decrease in their levels of self-rated health.},

  abstract = {The 15-minute city \textendash{} providing every resident's daily needs within a 15-minute walk, cycle or public transportation ride \textendash{} has recently gained popularity among policy makers as a means for a more sustainable and just future. While the goal of a more equitable and sustainable city is laudable, we note that half of the world's population (still) lives in non-urban areas and thus seek to explore how the concept of the 15-minute city might extend into suburbs, exurbs and even the countryside. We do this via an empirical analysis of 16~years of travel survey data in the Netherlands and evaluate the relevance of the 15-minute city concept in non-urban areas. We frame our analysis via three specific aspects of the 15-minute concept: (i) differences in reliance on cars in urban and non-urban areas; (ii) differences in extra travel time across the urban-rural continuum if all car-based trips were replaced by public transport; and (iii) the effect of accessibility of goods and services on extra travel time if all car-based trips were replaced by public transport. Based on our findings, we argue that practical implementations of the 15-minute city (focused on the urban core) risk missing the particular challenges facing non-urban neighborhoods, especially in terms of car reliance. As planners rush to address the affordable housing crisis in the Netherlands and elsewhere, these short-comings highlight the importance of expanding research and policy practice in terms of scope (i.e. including non-urban areas) and focus (i.e. considering other reasons for individual travel beyond goods and services) to better reflect the lived experience of people across all geographies.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;People living in peripheral rural areas are often considered to be prone to transport poverty and inaccessibility to activities. Previous identifications of transport poverty have mainly relied on accessibility measures based on land-use and transport data. However, such measures may be very different from how people themselves perceive accessibility. Therefore, explicitly considering perceptions of accessibility may be valuable in evaluating the nature of accessibility issues such as transport poverty. By conducting semi-structured focus group discussions in Zeeland, a rural area of the Netherlands, this paper shows that the mechanisms behind transport poverty are mediated by individual perceptions of accessibility. Local social norms related to accessibility appear to be important in shaping these perceptions. In peripheral rural areas, norms reflecting the dominance of the private car add to the negative appropriation of other transport options and shape expectations with respect to accessibility. Therefore, taking account of perceptions of accessibility, and the ways these are shaped, adds to the understanding of the nature of accessibility issues and is considered vital in designing responsive policies.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Accessibility analyses based on spatial data potentially fail to capture individual heterogeneity in needs, preferences and abilities, leading to mismatches with how accessibility is perceived. Using data from a self-administered survey (N\,=\,2227) in the Netherlands, this paper aims to evaluate which factors explain the differences between accessibility to daily activities calculated based on spatial data and perceived levels of accessibility in rural areas. Accessibility is perceived to be high on average, while 12\% are estimated to have, at least to some extent, low levels of perceived accessibility. Perceived accessibility poorly correlates with spatial accessibility but is rather moderated by individual factors. The integration of objective relatively easily obtainable individual contributors to perceived accessibility could already mitigate the gap with spatial accessibility indicators substantially. While car-ownership was a significant contributor to perceived accessibility in Dutch rural areas, it was found to be less relevant for people reporting very low levels for whom social disadvantages seem to matter more. Taking account of the individual dimension in the interpretation or construction of accessibility indicators based on spatial data will add to the validity of the use of these indicators in planning practice and, therefore, promote the shift to accessibility-based planning.},

However, perceived accessibility, defined as the perceived potential to participate in spatially dispersed opportunities, is often poorly reflected by these calculated measures. This paper sets out to explain the mechanisms that lead to these mismatches. A conceptual model is constructed to establish what factors shape perceived accessibility. A schematic framework shows that mismatches between a calculated indicator and perceptions can stem from inaccuracies in awareness as well as from inaccuracies in the measure if the measure fails to take account of the subjective evaluations of accessibility components. When evaluating the performance of land-use and transport system configurations, calculated measures based on spatial and transport data only serve as proxies for how accessibility is actually experienced. This paper argues that bringing perceived accessibility to the fore of accessibility-based planning, by acknowledging and evaluating potential mismatches with calculated accessibility indicators, will advance the evolution from mobility-based to accessibility-based planning.},

This paper explores the ``15-min city'' concept as a structural and functional element for redesigning contemporary cities. Methodologically, a study of three case cities that have adopted this new model of city vision, is carried out. The analysis focus on understanding how the idea of 15-min cities fits the legacies of different cities as described by traditional planning principles in the context of three evaluation pillars: inclusion, safety and health. The paper argues that the 15-min city approach is not a radical new idea since it utilizes long established planning principles. Nevertheless, it uses these principles to achieve the bottom-up promotion of wellbeing while it proposes an alternative way to think about optimal resource allocation in a citywide scale. Hence, application of 15-min city implies a shift in the emphasis of planning from the accessibility of neighborhood to urban functions to the proximity of urban functions within neighborhoods, along with large systemic changes in resource allocation patterns and governance schemes citywide.},

In particular, the promotion by the UK Department for Transport of accessibility planning is examined. Although this initiative is not totally without merit, the resulting analysis may be too aggregate, both spatially and socially. The weakness of such an approach is that transport-related social exclusion is not always a socially and spatially concentrated process. Instead we suggest a matrix of area accessibility, area mobility and individual mobility as a possible schema for identifying concentrated and scattered manifestations of social exclusion and inclusion and for suggesting appropriate policy responses. This schema helps produce a more spatially and socially differentiated conceptualisation of social exclusion, helps identify policy responses and most critically highlights that the problems of the socially excluded immobile should not be analysed in isolation from the socially included mobile.},

It uses two distinct population-specific benchmarks to determine the relative position of the subgroup: a theoretical worst-case and a theoretical best-case situation. An application of the index to transport is also presented, using 49 of the largest US metropolitan regions as case studies. Job accessibility by public transport is assessed for two population subgroups especially likely to benefit from public transport: adults without a car and adults living in poverty. It is found that the car-less population is comparatively better served by public transport than the poor population. Additionally, regions with a higher TPI score for car-less populations also tend to have public transport systems that better serve their population living in poverty. These results highlight that the proposed index allows for easy comparison across regions, despite large differences in the scale of the variable of interest (accessibility by public transport), the total population, and the size of the target groups (car-less or adults in poverty).},

Since providing access to destinations is a key purpose of transport systems, it should be important to systematically measure to what extent people experience travel problems. Yet, while some travel problems, such as travel time delays, are measured regularly, data collection on other problems is patchy at best. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a survey instrument to systematically determine the prevalence and severity of a broad range of travel problems among a population. The survey distinguishes between three problem types: difficulties related to actual trip-making (e.g., high travel costs), reliance on others for trip-making (e.g., being dropped off for lack of another option), and forgoing trips (e.g., forgoing a family visit for lack of suitable transport). The instrument is tested in a large-scale survey (n~=~1430 valid responses) in four areas in the Tel Aviv region. Confirmatory factor analysis largely corroborates the importance of distinguishing between the three types of travel problems. The resulting latent constructions are then used for cluster analysis. Results show that travel problems are concentrated among a small portion of the population (6\% of respondents), who regularly relied on others for trip making and frequently forwent trips. Further analysis showed this group to have low car ownership, below-average income, and a low educational level. The paper ends with suggestions for further improvement of the developed questionnaire and its relevance for transport planning and policy.},

This literature review investigates the impact of public transport on the health and well-being of older adults and discusses policy implications. A literature search was conducted in CINAHL, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and ProQuest Social Science databases to identify relevant articles. Fifty-eight articles were identified. Despite the prevalence of public transport including free and subsidised services worldwide, there is only a small body of research on the impact on older people. While limited, the literature on free and subsidised public transport and older people highlights that access has clear benefits for health and well-being. Public transport both promote active transport by encouraging older people to incorporate incidental activity into daily routines. We review literature showing that active transport positively affects older people's physical health, as well as their mental health by enabling them to maintain social networks, thus reducing social isolation.},

This paper reports on a thematic analysis of the unsolicited comments written within activity-travel diaries. Two key themes were identified: data quality and respondent affect. Comments about data quality pointed toward possible measurement error due to difficulties incorporating the study into everyday life, or due to human-error. Respondents also offered some additional context for reported data. Affective responses included apologizing for possible data errors and expressions of frustration with the survey. Most respondents who wrote unsolicited comments self-identified as female, of higher education, and employed full-time. The presence of unsolicited comments offered a unique window into the research experiences of the researched, questions and comments raised by participants point toward possibilities in terms of survey design and future research.},

In time the lectures became a restatement of his theory of justice as fairness, revised in light of his more recent papers and his treatise Political Liberalism (1993). As Rawls writes in the preface, the restatement presents ``in one place an account of justice as fairness as I now see it, drawing on all [my previous] works.'' He offers a broad overview of his main lines of thought and also explores specific issues never before addressed in any of his writings. Rawls is well aware that since the publication of A Theory of Justice in 1971, American society has moved farther away from the idea of justice as fairness. Yet his ideas retain their power and relevance to debates in a pluralistic society about the meaning and theoretical viability of liberalism. This book demonstrates that moral clarity can be achieved even when a collective commitment to justice is uncertain.},

Data came from 7 waves (2002\textendash 2014) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 17,953), which measured total cognitive function, memory, executive function, and processing speed before and after the bus pass was introduced in 2006. The analytical strategy was an instrumental-variable approach with fixed effects, which made use of the age-eligibility criteria for free bus passes and addressed bias due to reverse causality, measurement error, and time-invariant confounding. Eligibility for the bus pass was associated with a 7\% increase in public transport use. The increase in public transportation use was associated with a 0.346 (95\% confidence interval: 0.017, 0.674) increase in the total cognitive function z score and with a 0.546 (95\% confidence interval: 0.111, 0.982) increase in memory z score. Free bus passes were associated with an increase in public transport use and, in turn, benefits to cognitive function in older age. Public transport use might promote cognitive health through encouraging intellectually, socially, and physically active lifestyles. Transport policies could serve as public health tools to promote cognitive health in aging populations.},

However, external factors such as extreme weather or glitches in public transport, can cause demand to deviate from baseline levels. Identifying such outliers keeps historic data reliable and improves forecasts. In this paper we show how outliers can be identified by clustering stations and applying a functional depth analysis. We apply our analysis techniques to the Washington D.C. Capital Bikeshare data set as the running example throughout the paper, but our methodology is general by design. Furthermore, we offer an array of meaningful visualisations to communicate findings and highlight patterns in demand. Last but not least, we formulate managerial recommendations on how to use both the demand forecast and the identified outliers in the bike-sharing planning process.},

The chapter outlines the academic evidence on environmental injustice in transportation related to three dimensions: inequitable access to participation in the planning process; inequitable exposure to localized environmental burdens; and inequitable distribution of the benefits of transportation investments and systems. It also addresses how justice or fairness should be conceptualized along each dimension. The chapter concludes by synthesizing best practices from the academic literature, agency practice, and community activism to chart a path towards and develop an analytical framework to advance an equitable and just transportation system for the US and beyond.},

The geographical distribution of health facilities is an important factor in timely and quality access to emergency services; therefore, the present study analyzed the emergency health care network in Brazil, focusing the analysis at the roles of small hospitals (SHs). Study design Cross-sectional ecological study. Methods Data were collected from 9429 hospitals of which 3524 were SHs and 5905 were high-complexity centers (HCCs). For analytical purposes, we considered four specialties when examining the proxies of emergency care capability: adult, pediatrics, neonatal, and obstetric. We analyzed the spatial distribution of hospitals, identifying municipalities that rely exclusively on SHs and the distance of these cities from HCCs. Results More than 14 and 30 million people were at least 120~km away from HCCs with an adult intensive care unit (ICU) and pediatric ICU, respectively. For neonatal care distribution, 12\% of the population was more than 120~km away from a health facility with a neonatal ICU. The maternities situation is different from other specialties, where 81\% of the total Brazilian population was within 1~h or less from such health facilities. Conclusion Our results highlighted a polarization in distribution of Brazilian health care facilities. There is a concentration of hospitals in urban areas more developed and access gaps in rural areas and the Amazon region. Our results demonstrate that the distribution of emergency services in Brazil is not facilitating access to the population due to geographical barriers associated with great distances.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables\textemdash colliders and mediators\textemdash should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

It compares the mobility of these groups to that of the general population in three Canadian urban areas of Hamilton, Montreal and Toronto, based on data from large-sample metropolitan transport surveys. An ordered probit model with spatially expanded coefficients is used for the analysis. Spatial expansion shows that there are spatial mobility trends for elderly populations and low-income populations even after socio-economic attributes are accounted for. Such spatial differences are not generally found for single parent families. This novel spatial analysis provides clues as to where vulnerable populations may experience greater degrees of social exclusion. It provides information to help prioritize transportation infrastructure projects or other social programs to take into account the needs of vulnerable populations with the lowest levels of mobility.}

To stimulate discussion of outmoded thinking regarding the conduct of research, I list six misconceptions about research that persist long after their flaws have become apparent. The misconceptions are: 1) There is a hierarchy of study designs; randomized trials provide the greatest validity, followed by cohort studies, with case\textendash control studies being least reliable. 2) An essential element for valid generalization is that the study subjects constitute a representative sample of a target population. 3) If a term that denotes the product of two factors in a regression model is not statistically significant, then there is no biologic interaction between those factors. 4) When categorizing a continuous variable, a reasonable scheme for choosing category cut-points is to use percentile-defined boundaries, such as quartiles or quintiles of the distribution. 5) One should always report P values or confidence intervals that have been adjusted for multiple comparisons. 6) Significance testing is useful and important for the interpretation of data. These misconceptions have been perpetuated in journals, classrooms and textbooks. They persist because they represent intellectual shortcuts that avoid more thoughtful approaches to research problems. I hope that calling attention to these misconceptions will spark the debates needed to shelve these outmoded ideas for good.},

This volume brings together the leading scholars of the suburbs researching in different parts of the world to better understand how and why suburbs and their communities grow, decline, and regenerate. The volume sets out four goals: 1) to provide a synthesis and critical appraisal of the historical and current state of understanding about the development of suburbs in the world; 2) to provide a forum for a comprehensive examination into the conceptual, theoretical, spatial, and empirical discontents of suburbanization; 3) to engage in a scholarly conversation about the transformation of suburbs that is interdisciplinary in nature and bridges the divide between the Global North and the Global South; and 4) to reflect on the implications of the socioeconomic, cultural, and political transformations of the suburbs for policymakers and planners. The Routledge Companion to the Suburbs is composed of original, scholarly contributions from the leading scholars of the study of how and why suburbs grow, decline, and transform. Special attention is paid to the global nature of suburbanization and its regional variations, with a focus on comparative analysis of suburbs through regions across the world in the Global North and the Global South. Articulated in a common voice, the volume is integrated by the very nature of the concept of a suburb as the unit of analysis, offering multidisciplinary perspectives from the fields of economics, geography, planning, political science, sociology, and urban studies.},

  abstract = {A fair distribution of accessibility to key activities is a central concern for distributive justice in transport planning. This implies that disparities in accessibility and the negative effects associated with a lack of accessibility should be mitigated. However, even though accessibility is not purely spatial or static, it is conventionally treated as if it were. Several studies have significantly advanced the spatio-temporal representation of accessibility. However, there is still a lack of focus on how these dynamics affect different groups of people with differing socio-economic and demographic characteristics and how these dynamics might influence their travel mode choice. The aim of this paper is to analyse how differences in accessibility to the workplace by public transport during multiple times of the day are associated with the time period in which different groups of people commute to work, and how the flexibility of individuals' time constraints might influence whether they can and do commute using public transport. Using a transport justice-focused time geography perspective, this study draws on the spatio-temporal aspects of people's real activities based on travel survey data for the Stockholm Region. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the differences in accessibility to the workplace by public transport across multiple departure time periods; showing how these results compare with mode choice (if there is a choice); and revealing which socio-economic, demographic and geographical factors characterise these differences. This study also illustrates how a transport justice-focused time geography approach could help researchers have a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the relationship between accessibility and sustainable travel behaviour, and how this relationship might change at different times of the day.},

  abstract = {Recent transport equity literature has proposed a sufficientarian approach to transport planning, according to which all individuals would be entitled to a minimum level of accessibility deemed adequate or sufficient. The implementation of this approach would require the adoption of an accessibility standard as a key performance indicator guiding transport investments, land use planning and service provision. While accessibility measures are increasingly operationalised in professional practice, the adoption of actual accessibility standards is rare. In this paper, we explore the barriers for adopting explicit accessibility standards and identify conditions within which such standards could be acceptable to practitioners and policymakers. The paper draws on interviews with professionals in three city-regions in Sweden, complemented with interviews with practitioners from the Flanders region in Belgium and from the UK. We find that authorities are hesitant to define and measure accessibility and that where definitions and performance indicators exist, there is a lack of agreement within and across authorities. The prospect of introducing a standard across the board without attaching any conditions comprises a further reason for shying away from standard-setting. The (dis)integration of transport and land use and complicated administrative and governance structures are described as a further barrier, while demand responsive transport is in some cases considered a panacea to all accessibility problems, making it possible to avoid setting standards. Our findings suggest that standards for minimum accessibility could gain political support if their reach is clearly circumscribed, and their benefits are clearly understood.},

  abstract = {Accessibility is increasingly recognised as a key purpose of transport policies. Most of the common practices found both in academic studies and policy planning draw on relatively simple accessibility measures taken as `objective' indicators that only focus on the interaction between land use and transport. Relatively little attention has been paid to heterogeneity in individual characteristics and in self-reported perceptions of accessibility (`subjective' indicators), and the corresponding differences with respect to available modal options. This study includes a comparison of (1) `objective' indicators of accessibility to key activities by various modes of transport; and (2) individuals' own perceptions of their capability to access valuable out-of-home activities and the modal options available to them. This study examines the key differences between the two representations of accessibility. The calculated measure was developed using door-to-door travel times to supermarkets and healthcare centres using OpenTripPlanner. The self-reported measure was based on a dedicated capability-oriented travel survey of people aged 65\textendash 79 in Sweden's large metropolitan regions: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm\"o. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and binary and multinomial logistic regressions. The results of this study allow us to gain a greater insight into the ways in which the two accounts differ and can complement one another. We find that conventional methods, by overlooking the heterogeneity in people's perceptions of their accessibility, tend to overestimate accessibility levels and underestimate accessibility inequalities. This study shows how perceived accounts of accessibility can be incorporated into conventional accessibility models and improve accessibility analyses.},

The type of decision-making that is prevalent in a society depends upon the kinds of information available. In modern, Western-type democracies, it is taken for granted that well- informed planning and decision-making are grounded in the reliable prediction of impacts. Therefore, if unlimited mobility undermines predictability, it poses a threat to public planning and democratic governance in the transport sector. This exploratory and somewhat speculative essay about a possible future analyzes the planning consequences of the `death-of-distance' literature. It seeks to clarify just how planning might be transformed by the loss of consequential impact analysis. It is moreover suggested that the likely responses to mobility-induced unpredictability \textendash{} private rule following and public planning rituals \textendash{} would challenge modernist ideals.},

The framework focuses on key interactions and feedback mechanisms between infrastructure and surrounding environmental, economic, and social systems. One way of understanding and quantifying these interacting effects is through the use of sustainability criteria and indicators.

  abstract = {Road transport imposes negative externalities on society. These externalities include environmental and road damage, accidents, congestion, and oil dependence. The cost of these externalities to society is in general not reflected in the current market prices in the road transport sector. An efficient mobility model for the future must take into account the true costs of transport and its regulatory framework will need to create incentives for people to make sustainable transport choices. This paper discusses the use of economic instruments to correct road transport externalities, but gives relatively more weight to the problem of carbon emissions from road transport, as this is particularly challenging, given its global and long-term nature. Economics offers two types of instruments for addressing the problem of transport externalities: command-and-control and incentive-based policies. Command-and-control policies are government regulations which force consumers and producers to change their behaviour. They are the most widely used policy instruments. Examples include vehicle emission and fuel standards in the US as well as driving or parking restrictions in Singapore. The implementation cost of these instruments to the government is small. Although from an economic perspective these policies often fail to achieve an efficient market outcome, the presence of political constraints often make them the preferred option, in terms of feasibility and effectiveness. Economic theory shows how policies, which affect consumption and production incentives, can be used to achieve the optimal outcome in the presence of externalities. Incentive-based policies function within a new or an altered market. We first examine incentive-based policies, which cap the aggregate amount of the externality, such as carbon emissions, by allocating permits or rights to the emitters. The emitters are then free to trade their permits amongst them. The permit allocation mechanism is important\textendash although market efficiency would be satisfied by an auction, political influences usually favour a proportional allocation based on historic emissions. We discuss EU ETS as an example of a cap-and-trade system, however, no such policy for CO2 emissions in road transport has been implemented anywhere in the world to date. Fiscal instruments are, like command-and-control, widely used in road transport, because they are relatively cheap and simple to implement. They include the use of taxes and charges in order to bridge the gap between private and the social costs and, in principle, can lead to an efficient market solution. Registration, ownership, fuel, emissions, usage taxes, and parking and congestion charges have been implemented in many countries around the world. On the other side of the spectrum, subsidies can be given to those scrapping old cars and buying fuel-efficient vehicles. Some cities, such as London, have implemented congestion charges and many states in the United States have introduced high occupancy lanes. Other interesting possibilities include pay-as-you-drive insurance and other usage charges. However, the size and scope of taxes and subsidies are determined by governments, and because of their imperfect knowledge of the market the outcome is still likely to be inefficient. Governments have many effective economic instruments to create a sustainable road transport model. These instruments can be used separately or together, but their implementation will be necessary in the nearest future.},

Fifty-nine agencies, representing a broad cross-section of California transit operators, responded. Three quarters of respondents offered one or more free or reduced-fare transit pass programs in fiscal year 2018-19. While most respondents stated that free or reduced-fare transit passes increase ridership, many had concerns about the effect on their agency's farebox recovery ratio, and to some extent on the fiscal health of their agency, though almost half of the respondents did not know the actual impacts. Those agencies offering student pass programs funded by student fees or employee programs funded by employers did not report any negative impact on ridership or on farebox recovery ratios. This confirms that free or reduced-fare transit pass programs structured like insurance programs (where a large group of potential transit riders\textemdash such as all students at a college or all employees in a large firm\textemdash periodically pays a lump sum to a transit agency while only a subset of that group actually uses transit) can be good for both riders and transit agencies. Free or reduced fare pass programs have an important role to play in transportation policy in California, but we should not ask too much from these programs. To achieve their full potential, they should be integrated into comprehensive policies to achieve California's social and environmental goals.},

It compares empirical results of the different methods based on the data from a six-week travel diary. In general, the results show that the day-to-day behaviour is more variable if measured with trip-based methods instead of methods based on time budgets. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the similarity declines if the method captures more of the complexity of the travel pattern. It is also shown that travel behaviour is neither totally repetitious nor totally variable. Even for the whole observation period, it is demonstrated that two days always have some common elements. Additionally, it is found that the different methods yield the same pattern of variability for different types of day. Travel behaviour is clearly more stable on work days. Similar results for all methods are also obtained concerning the question of how long the minimum period of observation should be. All measures show that the period should not be less than two weeks if one aims at measuring variability.},

  abstract = {While calls for `environmental justice' have grown recently, very little attention has been paid to exactly what the `justice' of environmental justice refers to, particularly in the realm of social movement demands. Most understandings of environmental justice refer to the issue of equity, or the distribution of environmental ills and benefits. But defining environmental justice as equity is incomplete, as activists, communities, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) call for much more than just distribution. This essay examines how definitions beyond the distributive in these movements can help us develop conceptions of global environmental justice. The argument is that the justice demanded by global environmental justice is really threefold: equity in the distribution of environmental risk, recognition of the diversity of the participants and experiences in affected communities, and participation in the political processes which create and manage environmental policy. The existence of three different notions of justice in the movement, simultaneously, demonstrates the plausibility of a plural yet unified theory and practice of justice.},

This article maintains, on the contrary, that the very logic of historical materialism, notably the concept of the historical development of human needs, necessitates a concept of justice even in the higher phase of communism. Furthermore, the ``anti-juridical'' interpretation of Marx fails to provide an adequate account of the connection between the communist values of self-realization and community. It therefore obscures the concerns addressed by a notion of justice. The early Marx's concept of species-being (Gattungswesen) expresses the relation between self-realization and community in historical terms. Thus it provides an appropriate context for a Marxist theory of justice., Quelques marxologues actuels (notamment Allen Buchanan, Richard Miller et Allen Wood) ont ni\'e \`a l'id\'ee de justice tout r\^ole significatif dans la pens\'ee marxiste. Cet article soutient au contraire que la logique m\^eme du mat\'erialisme historique, notamment le concept de d\'eveloppement historique des besoins humains, n\'ecessite un concept de justice y compris pour le stade sup\'erieur du communisme. En outre, l'interpr\'etation \guillemotleft{} anti-juridique \guillemotright{} de Marx n'explique pas ad\'equatement le rapport entre les valeurs communistes d'auto-r\'ealisation et de communaut\'e. Cette interpr\'etation obscurcit ainsi l'objet m\^eme d'une notion de justice. La notion d'etre g\'en\'erique (Gattungswesen), dans les \'ecrits du jeune Marx, exprime ce rapport entre l'auto-r\'ealisation et la communaut\'e en termes historiques. Elle offre de cette mani\`ere un contexte appropri\'e pour une th\'eorie marxiste de la justice.},

  abstract = {Integrated, high quality, and accessible transit systems are essential for attracting travelers to shift from private to public. This change in personal behavior is desired in order to reduce congestion and air pollutant emissions in city centers. This paper focuses on evaluating the impact of fare integration on transit ridership and travel behavior, using the city of Haifa, Israel, as a case study. The city's new, integrated, fare policy changed the historically complex per-boarding system to a simple five-zone fare system with free transfers, reducing fares for many passengers. Using fare-box data, on-board surveys and travel-behavior model estimation, we show that the new fare policy managed to negate the downward trend in transit ridership. Fare-box data showed a significant increase in single ticket sales of up to 25\% over the first year following the launch of the reform; the survey's results pointed to an increase of 7.7\% in passenger trips and 18.6\% in boarding. The number of passenger boarding per trip increased from 1.38 to 1.52, implying that people were utilizing the free transfer option and enjoying a wider range of routes. The model results showed that fare reduction was a significant factor in attracting transit users, and that the public transport reform had three important contributions: first, it encouraged travelers to shift from private cars or taxi to buses; second, it created new trips, offering more opportunities for activity participation; and third, it increased travel options by allowing travelers to choose a better route.},

  abstract = {The social sciences have generally ignored the motor car and its awesome consequences for social life, especially in their analysis of the urban. Urban studies in particular has failed to consider the overwhelming impact of the automobile in transforming the time-space `scapes' of the modern urban/suburban dweller. Focusing on forms of mobility into, across and through the city, we consider how the car reconfigures urban life, involving distinct ways of dwelling, travelling and socializing in, and through, an automobilized time-space. We trace urban sociology's paradoxical resistance to cultures of mobility, and argue that civil society should be reconceptualized as a `civil society of automobility'. We then explore how automobility makes instantaneous time and the negotiation of extensive space central to how social life is configured. As people dwell in and socially interact through their cars, they become hyphenated car-drivers: at home in movement, transcending distance to complete a series of activities within fragmented moments of time. Urban social life has always entailed various mobilities but the car transforms these in a distinct combination of flexibility and coercion. Automobility is a complex amalgam of interlocking machines, social practices and ways of dwelling which have reshaped citizenship and the public sphere via the mobilization of modern civil societies. In the conclusion we trace a vision of an evolved automobility for the cities of tomorrow in which public space might again be made `public'. Les sciences sociales ignorent g\'en\'eralement la voiture et ses cons\'equences impressionnantes sur la vie sociale, notamment dans le domaine urbain. En effet, les \'etudes urbaines ont n\'eglig\'e la spectaculaire incidence de l'automobile dans la transformation des `paysages' spatio-temporels que conna\^it l'habitant des villes et des banlieues d'aujourd'hui. En s'attachant aux formes de mobilit\'e dans, \`a travers et d'un bout \`a l'autre de la ville, nos travaux observent de quelle mani\`ere la voiture reconfigure la vie urbaine, impliquant des modes d'habitat, de d\'eplacement et de socialisation distincts dans et \`a travers un espace-temps `automobilis\'e`. Notre recherche montre la r\'esistance paradoxale de la sociologie urbaine \`a l'\'egard des cultures de mobilit\'e, en sugg\'erant une reconceptualisation de la soci\'et\'e civile en tant que `soci\'et\'e civile de mobilit\'e automobile`. L'article explore ensuite comment, du fait de cette mobilit\'e, l'instantan\'eit\'e et la n\'egociation d'un espace \'etendu deviennent essentiels dans la configuration de la vie sociale. Les individus habitant dans leur voiture et vivant des interactions sociales au-travers de celle-ci, ils se transforment en conducteurs automobiles par nature: \'etant chez eux en d\'eplacement et transcendant la distance pour r\'ealiser un encha\^inement d'activit\'es dans un cadre temporel fragment\'e. La vie sociale urbaine a toujours englob\'e des mobilit\'es vari\'ees, mais la voiture transforme celles-ci en une combinaison particuli\`ere de flexibilit\'e et de contrainte. La mobilit\'e automobile est un amalgame complexe de machines imbriqu\'ees, de pratiques sociales et de modes d'habitat qui ont refa??onn\'e la citoyennet\'e et la sph\`ere publique via la mobilisation des soci\'et\'es civiles modernes.

  abstract = {Studies that examine spatial characteristics of urban unemployment are often based on some simplistic measures of employment accessibility. In this paper a refined methodological framework for measuring accessibility is presented, which enables the researcher (1) to improve the measurement by accounting for job competition among workers commuting by different modes, and (2) to understand the outcome more thoroughly by distinguishing the effect of location from that of workers' auto ownership. This refined framework is applied to a case study of employment accessibility of low-wage workers living in Boston's inner-city neighborhoods, with primarily 1990 Census demographic and journey-to-work data. The empirical results show clearly that, although the central location of inner-city residence still gives the low-wage workers some advantage, auto ownership is the more important determinant. Low-wage workers living in inner-city neighborhoods on average do not have high employment accessibility because a large percentage of them do not own any motor vehicle and hence have limited spatial mobility. Implications of the findings are discussed and qualified in light of the limitation of the research.},

Thematic maps for the 20 largest U.S. metropolitan areas and regression models for the Boston case reveal important spatial and social dimensions of commuting. The main findings are: (1) commute time tends to be longer for low-income minorities than for other residents of the central city; (2) the urban spatial structure is highly significant and important in explaining variations in commute time; and (3) a considerable number of other factors also influence commute duration. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

However, these studies continue to operate on an aggregate level, often without differentiating pedestrians by gender, age, and ability. The lack of higher-order socioeconomic and affective factors such as social norms and comfort reflects a lack of attention to diversity. The ubiquitous importance of hand-held mobile devices, although undercut by the lack of a single mobile platform, suggests the possibility of crowd-sourced assessments.

  abstract = {In this essay, first, considerations are made about the pertinence of the concepts worked on by Roberto DaMatta in the studied work; then, considerations are made about the context in which the work was elaborated; in continuity, the detachment with comments of excerpts of the work is carried out, making the correlation with the perspective of the fare-free and the access to the city. Finally, in the conclusion, a debate is made about the pertinence of the work under study with current themes. The transformation of cities reveals mechanisms of production of inequalities that can be better understood through theoretical elements. In this process, the definition of house and street as proposals for analysis can be a relevant issue to identify how these definitions work with each other and in relation to the way cities develop. The exercise of citizenship through access to the city is a way of understanding the relationship between individual behavior practiced in the family environment and collective behavior practiced in the collective environment. Questioning the way in which urban inequalities manifest themselves may require theories that elevate everyday categories to the level of key classification elements, as proposed by Roberto DaMatta. The current debate on the fare free proposals helps to make a new reading of the present and future of cities in accordance with the intention of reducing limitations to citizenship and helps to apply and update the classifications proposed by the author.},

Bolsa Fam\'ilia has several design and implementation characteristics that distance it from a pure human-capital-based conditional cash transfer model. For that reason, we compare the impact of Bolsa Fam\'ilia to that of other conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile. We show that, as have other programs, Bolsa Fam\'ilia has helped reduce inequality and extreme poverty and has improved education outcomes, without having a negative impact on labor force participation. Where the program has failed to have its intended impact, in health and nutrition, supply-side constraints seem to be the principal problem. Esta nota resume a performance do Programa Bolsa Fam\'ilia em termos de sua focaliza\c{c}\~ao e seu impacto sobre desigualdade, pobreza, consumo, educa\c{c}\~ao, sa\'ude e participa\c{c}\~ao na for\c{c}a de trabalho. O desenho e a implementa\c{c}\~ao do Bolsa Fam\'ilia apresenta caracter\'isticas que o distanciam de um programa "puro"de transfer\^encia condicionada de renda baseado no capital humano. Por este motivo, n\'os comparamos o impacto do Bolsa Fam\'ilia com o de outros programas de transfer\^encias condicionadas da Am\'erica Latina, como aqueles do M\'exico, Col\^ombia, Equador e Chile. N\'os mostramos que assim como outros programas, o Bolsa Fam\'ilia ajudou a reduzir a desigualdade e a extrema pobreza e teve impactos positivos sobre indicadores educacionais, sem apresentar resultados negativos sobre a participa\c{c}\~ao na for\c{c}a de trabalho.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lack of reliable transportation can be a barrier to keeping appointments or accessing other health care services. Increasingly, insurers and health care delivery systems subsidize transportation services for patients. This systematic review synthesizes existing research on nonemergency medical transportation interventions. METHODS: We searched 3 databases (Embase, PubMed, Google) for studies of health care sector-sponsored programs that provided patients assistance with nonemergency transportation and directly assessed the impact of transportation assistance on health and health care utilization outcomes. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were graded for quality using standard grading criteria. FINDINGS: Eight studies met all inclusion criteria. Most were rated as low quality. All studies included examined process or health care utilization outcomes, such as uptake of transportation services, return for follow-up, or missed appointment rates; only 1 included health outcomes, such as illness severity and blood pressure. Results were mixed. More rigorous studies showed low patient uptake of transportation services and inconsistent impacts on health and utilization outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite considerable interest in subsidizing transportation services to improve health for patients facing transportation barriers, little rigorously conducted research has demonstrated the impact of transportation services on health or health care utilization. Some extant literature suggests that transportation assistance is more likely to be effective when offered with other interventions to reduce social and economic barriers to health.},

The report proposes a comprehensive active transportation network for Scarborough at the scale necessary to achieve existing City of Toronto policy targets. The suggestion is not that this is the only possible network, but that without a long-term plan for a comprehensive network, Toronto is unlikely to be able to significantly improve conditions for active transportation. It is past time to elevate our ambition and to transform Scarborough into a walkable, bikeable, and more livable place.  The City of Toronto must develop a comprehensive active transportation plan and a realistic timeline for building pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in order to achieve the City's policy goal of dramatically increasing the use of active transportation in Scarborough.},

  abstract = {Proximity to health care, healthy foods, and recreation is linked to improved health in older adults while deterioration of the built environment is a risk factor for poor health. Yet, it remains unclear whether individuals prone to good health self-select into favorable built environments and how long-term exposure to deteriorated environments impacts health. This study uses a longitudinal framework to address these questions.The study analyzes 3,240 Americans aged 45 or older from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with good self-reported health at baseline, and follows them from 1999 to 2013. At each biennial survey wave, individual data are combined with data on services in the neighborhood of residence (defined as the zip code) from the Economic Census. The analysis overcomes the problem of residential self-selection by employing marginal structural models and inverse probability of treatment weights.Logistic regression estimates indicate that long-term exposure to neighborhood built environments that lack health-supportive services (e.g., physicians, pharmacies, grocery stores, senior centers, and recreational facilities) and are commercially declined (i.e., have a high density of liquor stores, pawn shops, and fast food outlets) increases the risk of fair/poor self-rated health compared to more average neighborhoods. Short-term exposure to the same environments as compared to average neighborhoods has no bearing on self-rated health after adjusting for self-selection.Results highlight the importance of expanding individuals' access to health-supportive services prior to their reaching old age, and expanding access for people unlikely to attain residence in service-dense neighborhoods.},

However, for moderate to highly motorised cities, such as Melbourne, London, and Boston, the compact city scenario predicted a small increase in road trauma for cyclists and pedestrians (health loss of between 34 and 41 DALYs per 100\hphantom{,}000 population). The findings suggest that government policies need to actively pursue land-use elements\textemdash particularly a focus towards compact cities\textemdash that support a modal shift away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and low-emission public transport. At the same time, these policies need to ensure the provision of safe walking and cycling infrastructure.

Based on the premise that leveraging accessibility concepts to address public involvement challenges could promote their adoption in planning practice, this research investigates mechanisms to promote social learning among participants in public workshops. Potential mechanisms of learning include specific tool-based interactions and how such interactions reinforce structures of learning such as alignment and imagination. This paper details iterative testing of these mechanisms with a tool called CoAXs (short for Collaborative ACCESSibility-based stakeholder engagement system), through focus groups and exploratory workshops. A mixed-methods analysis of the workshops supports the expectation that alignment and imagination correlate positively with social learning, as measured by reported learning and dialog quality. Specific interactions with the accessibility-based features of CoAXs in turn correlate positively with alignment and imagination, at individual and group levels of analysis. These findings, while not robustly generalizable, suggest that effective targeted stakeholder engagement for public transport can be structured around collaborative accessibility mapping. Adoption for broader public participation requires further development, especially the incorporation of actual day-to-day experiences such as unreliable operations.},

The current paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature by reviewing the methodologies, underlying theories, and findings presented in the individual academic studies on BRT land-use and price impacts, mostly drawing on those that have focused on Latin American and Asian systems. The review shows that the land-use and value impacts have been less uniform across systems compared to such operational performance metrics as speed and travel time improvements. While predominantly relying on cross-sectional modeling techniques, the approaches used to evaluate land-use changes induced by the transit systems are not uniform either, with only some studies explicitly measuring changes in types of land use as opposed to simply land or rental price. The study also concludes that more rigorous evaluation is needed as to whether the BRT systems have improved accessibility for the populations that inhabited the corridors previously or whether, instead, the desired land value increases have in fact resulted in significant population displacement.},

  abstract = {The regression discontinuity (RD) design offers identification of causal effects under weak assumptions, earning it a position as a standard method in modern political science research. But identification does not necessarily imply that causal effects can be estimated accurately with limited data. In this paper, we highlight that estimation under the RD design involves serious statistical challenges and investigate how these challenges manifest themselves in the empirical literature in political science. We collect all RD-based findings published in top political science journals in the period 2009\textendash 2018. The distribution of published results exhibits pathological features; estimates tend to bunch just above the conventional level of statistical significance. A reanalysis of all studies with available data suggests that researcher discretion is not a major driver of these features. However, researchers tend to use inappropriate methods for inference, rendering standard errors artificially small. A retrospective power analysis reveals that most of these studies were underpowered to detect all but large effects. The issues we uncover, combined with well-documented selection pressures in academic publishing, cause concern that many published findings using the RD design may be exaggerated.},

To do so, the paper is analysing a concrete example of the FFPT practice in Fr\'ydek-M\'istek (Czechia) by conducting surveys with the residents and interviews with the city planning authorities. The results show that the FFPT influences mobility strategies and dynamics in the given transport system, which imprints in an increased use of public transport. However, the FFPT does not represent a universal tool of urban and transport planning and its implementation into practice should take place in synergy with other transport (dis)incentives.},

  abstract = {Background The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), works to ensure accessible, quality, health care for the nation's underserved populations, especially those who are medically, economically, or geographically vulnerable. HRSA-designated primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas (pcHPSAs) provide a vital measure by which to identify underserved populations and prioritize locations and populations lacking access to adequate primary and preventive health care\textendash the foundation for advancing health equity and maintaining health and wellness for individuals and populations. However, access to care is a complex, multifactorial issue that involves more than just the number of health care providers available, and pcHPSAs alone cannot fully characterize the distribution of medically, economically, and geographically vulnerable populations. Methods and findings In this county-level analysis, we used descriptive statistics and multiple correspondence analysis to assess how HRSA's pcHPSA designations align geographically with other established markers of medical, economic, and geographic vulnerability. Reflecting recognized social determinants of health (SDOH), markers included demographic characteristics, race and ethnicity, rates of low birth weight births, median household income, poverty, educational attainment, and rurality. Nationally, 96 percent of U.S. counties were either classified as whole county or partial county pcHPSAs or had one or more established markers of medical, economic, or geographic vulnerability in 2017, suggesting that at-risk populations were nearly ubiquitous throughout the nation. Primary care HPSA counties in HHS Regions 4 and 6 (largely lying within the southeastern and south central United States) had the most pervasive and complex patterns in population risk. Conclusion HHS Regions displayed unique signatures with respect to SDOH markers. Descriptive and analytic findings from our work may help inform health workforce and health care planning at all levels, and, by illustrating both the complexity of and differences in county-level population characteristics in pcHPSA counties, our findings may have relevance for strengthening the delivery of primary care and addressing social determinants of health in areas beset by provider shortages.},

We found a perceived high social-environmental quality of the residential environment to be associated with higher levels of self-rated health and leisure time physical activity. Both leisure time physical activity and satisfaction with environmental quality were independently linked with self-rated health. Furthermore, a high level of satisfaction with the individual's local infrastructure may support the residents to engage in higher levels of physical activity for transportation, whereas the preferred mode of transportation may be gender-specific: men tend to use the bicycle while women walk. Our results suggest that local infrastructure facilities should be designed so as to ensure accessibility by both walking and cycling.},

Transportation barriers lead to rescheduled or missed appointments, delayed care, and missed or delayed medication use. These consequences may lead to poorer management of chronic illness and thus poorer health outcomes. However, the significance of these barriers is uncertain based on existing literature due to wide variability in both study populations and transportation barrier measures. The authors sought to synthesize the literature on the prevalence of transportation barriers to health care access. A systematic literature search of peer-reviewed studies on transportation barriers to healthcare access was performed. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) study addressed access barriers for ongoing primary care or chronic disease care; (2) study included assessment of transportation barriers; and (3) study was completed in the United States. In total, 61 studies were reviewed. Overall, the evidence supports that transportation barriers are an important barrier to healthcare access, particularly for those with lower incomes or the under/uninsured. Additional research needs to (1) clarify which aspects of transportation limit health care access (2) measure the impact of transportation barriers on clinically meaningful outcomes and (3) measure the impact of transportation barrier interventions and transportation policy changes.},

Logistic regression models were used, with age and sex as covariables, and educational level, a household assets index, and work-related indicators as measures of socioeconomic status. Besides the effects of sex and age, with consistently worst health perception among females and among the eldest, the results showed pronounced socioeconomic inequalities. After adjusting for age, among females the factors that contributed most to deterioration of health perception were incomplete education and material hardship; among males, besides material hardship, work related indicators (manual work, unemployment, work retirement or incapable to work) were also important determining factors. Among individuals with long-term illness or disability, the socioeconomic gradient persisted, although of smaller magnitude.},

It presents an exploratory, large sample look at the degree to which the blocks of one US city, Chicago, actually conform to idealized main street principles. The paper offers both an empirical and a methodological contribution: what metrics might be used to capture main street principles, and how does a large city like Chicago stack up to these stated norms? Eight variables are operationalized at the block level. While the metrics here do not reflect absolute consensus about what is important in an urban neighbourhood's commercial core, they do cover three dominant narratives: servicing, opportunity and quality. The paper finds that the overlap in these three dimensions is weak.},

This study addresses each of these shortcomings by (1) conducting a cross-sectional analysis of transit use in 265 US urbanized areas, (2) testing dozens of variables measuring regional geography, metropolitan economy, population characteristics, auto/highway system characteristics, and transit system characteristics, and (3) constructing two-stage simultaneous equation regression models to account for simultaneity between transit service supply and consumption. We find that most of the variation in transit ridership among urbanized areas \textendash{} in both absolute and relative terms \textendash{} can be explained by factors outside of the control of public transit systems: (1) regional geography (specifically, area of urbanization, population, population density, and regional location in the US), (2) metropolitan economy (specifically, personal/household income), (3) population characteristics (specifically, the percent college students, recent immigrants, and Democratic voters in the population), and (4) auto/highway system characteristics (specifically, the percent carless households and non-transit/non-SOV trips, including commuting via carpools, walking, biking, etc.). While these external factors clearly go a long way toward determining the overall level of transit use in an urbanized area, we find that transit policies do make a significant difference. The observed range in both fares and service frequency in our sample could account for at least a doubling (or halving) of transit use in a given urbanized area. Controlling for the fact that public transit use is strongly correlated with urbanized area size, about 26\% of the observed variance in per capita transit patronage across US urbanized areas is explained in the models presented here by service frequency and fare levels. The observed influence of these two factors is consistent with both the literature and intuition: frequent service draws passengers, and high fares drive them away.},

DAGitty is a popular web application for drawing and analysing DAGs. Here we introduce the R package `dagitty', which provides access to all of the capabilities of the DAGitty web application within the R platform for statistical computing, and also offers several new functions. We describe how the R package `dagitty' can be used to: evaluate whether a DAG is consistent with the dataset it is intended to represent; enumerate `statistically equivalent' but causally different DAGs; and identify exposure-outcome adjustment sets that are valid for causally different but statistically equivalent DAGs. This functionality enables epidemiologists to detect causal misspecifications in DAGs and make robust inferences that remain valid for a range of different DAGs. The R package `dagitty' is available through the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/]. The source code is available on github at [https://github.com/jtextor/dagitty].

Doing so, however, depends upon the reduction of uncertainties and inconsistencies in the process of comparison; and this poses particularly significant challenges for the behavioral and social sciences because they work with human subjects, whose malleability and complexity often interact in unexpected ways with experimental manipulations, thus resulting in unpredictable behavior. Drawing on the Science and Technology Studies perspective and one of our authors' experiences in experimental work, this paper examines how experimental social scientists manage to establish objectivity and standardization in the face of vagaries arising from working with human subjects. In identifying experimental researchers' solutions to this challenge, we draw on methodological discussions among applied social scientists as naturally occurring data, through which we show how some seemingly mundane practices play essential roles in extracting patterns out of otherwise unpredictable behaviors in the lab. Closely examining such strategies, we reveal the inherent instabilities in the experimental method when adopted in the social sciences and discuss their methodological implications. In conclusion, we make tentative suggestions for escaping the kinds of methodological impasses which we have identified.},

  abstract = {The quantitative measurement of accessibility through public transport has become more complex and accurate over time. However, it lacks many of the deeper nuances of how people actually experience their travel environments. Our previous works have highlighted the importance of incorporating the lived travel experiences of passengers within accessibility indicators, considering the quality of the walking environment and different attributes of the public transport services. Building on these works, this mixed-method research seeks to further improve the characterization of accessibility according to users' travel experiences, as described by those attributes that inhibit or enhance access to opportunities within the city. We use content analysis of focus groups, data gathered in a brief survey and sociodemographic and public transport data for our analyses. Our main contributions are (i) to develop a conceptual framework to analyze qualitative data on how people relate and discuss their public transport accessibility experiences and (ii) to develop accessibility indicators differentiating user perceptions. We apply this novel conceptual framework and methods to the unique urban morphology of two municipalities of Santiago de Chile. We identified different `socially constructed' narratives for buses and metro. The participants focused on barriers to accessibility, showing an important relationship between them, as well as substantial differences in their overarching positive perception of metro and negative for buses. However, when disaggregating the analysis by primary transport mode and location, we found `hidden' values for buses, recognizing its capillarity and underlying connectivity with the metro system. Furthermore, we found a dissimilar perception of transport environments when disaggregating the analysis by gender, age and location, which translated into different accessibility profiles for the various public transport users. From these experiential qualitative perspectives, it was thus possible to determine some attributes that had been previously overlooked in more quantitative studies but which are important when analyzing public transport accessibility for different population groups.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the distance of residence from a Gynecological Oncology Service (GOS) was associated with a better survival from ovarian cancer. METHODS: We linked cancer registry records to hospital records for 3749 women with ovarian cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 in New South Wales, Australia. Access to a GOS was measured in kilometers from a woman's geocoded address to the geocoded address of the closest public GOS hospital. Flexible parametric survival, Cox proportional hazards, and logistic regression models were fitted to examine whether better access to a GOS was associated with a better survival and whether extensive surgery was received for ovarian cancer after adjustment for patient, tumor, and treatment factors. RESULTS: Hazard of death from ovarian cancer was greater in women who were treated in a public general hospital than in women treated in a GOS hospital (hazards ratio, 0.77; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.95), and greater in those who did not have extensive surgery than in those who did (hazards ratio, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.58). The further women with ovarian cancer lived from a public GOS hospital, the more likely they were to be treated in a public general hospital. Women were 19 times more likely (odds ratio, 19.40; 95\% CI, 13.92-27.04) to be treated only in a general hospital when they lived 187 km or more from a public GOS hospital than women who lived within 5 km of one. CONCLUSIONS: Distance of residence from GOS hospitals in Australia is an important determinant of access to GOS hospitals. Treatment in a public or private GOS hospital and having surgery were the strongest predictors of survival from epithelial ovarian cancer. Research is required into the barriers to referral of patients with ovarian cancer for care in GOS hospitals; low population density limits options for supply of GOS in rural areas.},

These data were paired to geographic coordinates of all adult level I and II trauma centers within an 8.0-km buffer of each city. Between February and September 2018, small-area analyses were conducted to assess trauma desert status as a function of neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, and geospatial analyses were conducted to examine statistically significant trauma desert hot spots.In small-area analyses, a trauma desert was defined as travel distance greater than 8.0 km to the nearest adult level I or level II trauma center. In geospatial analyses, relative trauma deserts were identified using travel distance as a continuous measure. Census tracts were classified into (1) racial/ethnic composition categories, based on patterns of residential segregation, including white majority, black majority, Hispanic/Latino majority, and other or integrated; and (2) poverty categories, including nonpoor and poor.Chicago, LA, and NYC contained 798, 1006, and 2128 census tracts, respectively. A large proportion comprised a black majority population in Chicago (35.1\%) and NYC (21.4\%), compared with LA (2.7\%). In primary analyses, black majority census tracts were more likely than white majority census tracts to be located in a trauma desert in Chicago (odds ratio [OR], 8.48; 95\% CI, 5.71-12.59) and LA (OR, 5.11; 95\% CI, 1.50-17.39). In NYC, racial/ethnic disparities were not significant in unadjusted models, but were significant in models adjusting for poverty and race-poverty interaction effects (adjusted OR, 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.27-2.74). In comparison, Hispanic/Latino majority census tracts were less likely to be located in a trauma desert in NYC (OR, 0.03; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.11) and LA (OR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.22-0.40), but slightly more likely in Chicago (OR, 2.38; 95\% CI, 1.56-3.64).In this study, black majority census tracts were the only racial/ethnic group that appeared to be associated with disparities in geographic access to trauma centers.}

We are also witnessing, however, the reverse movement of the increasing return to the inner-city. This contradiction raises questions regarding contemporary urban growth and the socio-spatial production of the suburbs. This paper draws on the case of new town Almere in the metropolitan region of Amsterdam to cast light upon the changing suburban\textendash urban relationship, by investigating the mobility to and from Almere for two decades through socio-economic, demographic data between 1990 and 2013. We demonstrate that Almere has developed from a typically suburban family community to a receiver of both international unmarried newcomers and families; its population has also become relatively poorer, yet the levels of upwards income mobility have remained stable. These trends emphasise alternative types of mobilities emerging in concert to the more typical suburban migration. The town's transformation challenges the urban\textendash suburban dichotomy, pointing to alternative explanations of contemporary urban growth and metropolitan integration.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with how to conceptualize and theorize the nature of the `car system' that is a particularly key, if surprisingly neglected, element in `globalization'. The article deploys the notion of systems as self-reproducing or autopoietic. This notion is used to understand the origins of the 20th-century car system and especially how its awesome pattern of path dependency was established and exerted a particularly powerful and self-expanding pattern of domination across the globe. The article further considers whether and how the 20th-century car system may be transcended. It elaborates a number of small changes that are now occurring in various test sites, factories, ITC sites, cities and societies. The article briefly considers whether these small changes may in their contingent ordering end this current car system. The article assesses whether such a new system could emerge well before the end of this century, whether in other words some small changes now may produce the very large effect of a new post-car system that would have great implications for urban life, for mobility and for limiting projected climate change.},

  abstract = {From the end of the 1990s onwards the digital divide, commonly defined as the gap between those who have and do not have access to computers and the Internet, has been a central issue on the scholarly and political agenda of new media development. This article makes an inventory of 5 years of digital divide research (2000\textendash 2005). The article focuses on three questions. (1) To what type of inequality does the digital divide concept refer? (2) What is new about the inequality of access to and use of ICTs as compared to other scarce material and immaterial resources? (3) Do new types of inequality exist or rise in the information society? The results of digital divide research are classified under four successive types of access: motivational, physical, skills and usage. A shift of attention from physical access to skills and usage is observed. In terms of physical access the divide seems to be closing in the most developed countries; concerning digital skills and the use of applications the divide persists or widens. Among the shortcomings of digital divide research are its lack of theory, conceptual definition, interdisciplinary approach, qualitative research and longitudinal research.},

The focus in the literature is generally on methods and concept and/or on applications. Applications generally focus on ex ante or ex post evaluations of the implications for accessibility of (candidate) policy plans. An important question is which are the main challenges in the area of accessibility research? This paper aims to examine this question and provide a research agenda for the coming one or two decades or so. The focus is on putting relatively new topics on the agenda, rather than making suggestions for improvements of given accessibility indicators. The paper does not aim to provide a complete list, but rather proposes avenues for future research focusing on (1) indicators to express accessibility, and (2) evaluation. In the area of indicators the challenges include the impact of ICT on accessibility; the inclusion of the robustness of the transport system in indicators; comparing perceptions of accessibility and traditional accessibility indicators; the option value; and the indicators of accessibility for goods transport, air transport, and slow modes. In the area of evaluation the paper discusses the pros and cons of the logsum as an accessibility measure, ethical aspects, comparisons of accessibility indicators to evaluate a specific case, and the needs of the clients of accessibility research.},

In line with the Theory of Planned Behaviour, attitudes \textendash{} which affect behaviour \textendash{} are generally assumed to be constant. However, it is plausible that attitudes can change, both directly, or indirectly, through the impact of the built environment on travel behaviour, a process which is referred to as reverse causality (RC). Based on literature from social psychology, this paper provides a conceptual model for the explanation of attitude changes. It also reviews the literature in the area of BE and TB concluding that two explanations dominate: a change in attitudes due to new experiences which can be underpinned by learning theories, and a change in attitudes due to mismatches between attitudes and behaviour which can be explained by cognitive dissonance theories. The literature also suggests a few additional explanations, while we also suggest explanations not provided in travel behaviour literature. Finally, we present an agenda for future research.},

These innovations were introduced on top of a strong primary care tradition of family practices with defined populations based on patient panels, practice-based research, evidence-based medicine, large-scale computerization, and strong primary care health informatics. Dutch health reform redirected payment to support introduction of innovative health plans and strengthening of primary care to respond to public health objectives. Five recommendations for US primary care follow from this Dutch experience: (1) a private insurance model is compatible with thriving primary care, but it must include all people, especially the most vulnerable in society, and espouse a primary care\textendash led health care system; (2) patient panels or practice lists strengthen continuity of care and community orientation to focus on and respond to local needs; (3) reward collaboration within primary care and between primary care, hospital care, and public health; (4) stimulate primary care professionals to exert their passion and expertise through participation in primary care research and development; and (5) health informatics should be primary care based, preferably adopting the International Classification of Primary Care. With these recommendations, it will be possible for the United States to obtain better population health for its population.}

This is implemented by means of local spatial autocorrelation of response types of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and land use. Spatial heterogeneity was tested by assessment of the stratified responses of the survey, ranging from excellent to poor. A total of 8212 collected surveys from the CCHS master file for 2010 were used. Georeferenced surveys were agglomerated at census tract level, and spatial autocorrelation followed assessing of frequency distribution. The geography of the hotpots of surveys per response type was conducted. The resulting hotspots were compared to the properties of their land use types as to understand what the influence on surrounding land use on self-reported health is. A significant spatial autocorrelation exists over the region area concerning health perception, forming clusters in certain regions. A negative influence on self-reported health was found in commercial and industrial land use, while open spaces, on the other hands show significantly positive responses. While resource and industrial land use share a negative influence of self-reported health, open spaces and parks and recreational areas may lead to a better health perception. From a landscape and planning perspective, we argue that land use plays a crucial role in the complex social factors of health self-report. Geographic Information Systems and spatial analysis may allow to better understanding the combination of health factors and land use, as to allow a better planning of infrastructure and anthropogenic land use phenotypes for increasing health self-perception and wellbeing in developed countries.},

  abstract = {A growing concern for mobility-related social inclusion and equity is evident from both academic research and planning best practices. Scholarly research promotes accessibility as the main aim of transport planning, assuming it as the evaluative approach that better conveys how mobility contributes to individuals' well-being and participation in social life. Accessibility can be crucial to address the socio-spatial inequalities that characterise manifold settings across the world. Amongst them, Latin American countries have been keen in tackling such imbalances through mobility-related interventions, as the renowned cases of Curitiba, Medellin and Bogot\'a show. The widespread interest in mobility as both a cause and effect of social disparities has generated an increasing stream of work that examines Latin American settings through the lenses of accessibility. This paper aims at critically reviewing the growing scholarly works that, providing accessibility-based evaluations, has examined issues of transport and equity in Latin America. Proposing a novel conceptual framework that considers the underlying ethical stance, components of accessibility and implications for planning and policy, this work examines what approaches, features and indicators are present in the current literature, as well as what settings have been taken into consideration by scholarly research. Moreover, the review has an explicit operational interest, to define what indicators are relevant or missing to assess accessibility in the light of social concerns, as well as to consider the current and potential implications that such research findings have on transport planning and policy. The review highlights how a growing but still limited body of work has examined transport and equity in Latin America, suggesting academic, technical and operational avenues to enhance theoretical and practical approaches to the issue.},

I define the requirements of a best-practice transport CBA and show the difficulties in achieving these for large-scale projects. The main difficulties discussed are those of forecasting over long time periods, dealing with imperfect competition in transport-using sectors to obtain estimations of wider transport benefits, introducing private finance and appraising network effects. I conclude that CBA can remain a valuable tool as part of the appraisal process but that the inputs to a CBA have to be carefully assessed, and complementary approaches, such as computable general equilibrium modelling, have a useful role to play for very large or network projects.}

Currently available tools for road network data quality assessment often fail to account for network topology, spatial heterogeneity, and bicycle-specific data characteristics. To fill these gaps, we introduce BikeDNA, an open-source tool for reproducible quality assessment tailored to bicycle infrastructure data with a focus on network structure and connectivity. BikeDNA performs either a standalone analysis of one data set or a comparative analysis between OpenStreetMap and a reference data set, including feature matching. Data quality metrics are considered both globally for the entire study area and locally on grid cell level, thus exposing spatial variation in data quality. Interactive maps and HTML/PDF reports are generated to facilitate the visual exploration and communication of results. BikeDNA supports quality assessments of bicycle infrastructure data for a wide range of applications -- from urban planning to OpenStreetMap data improvement or network research for sustainable mobility.},

  abstract = {Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8\% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5\% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8\% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1\% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20\textendash 24 h per day at home (84.7\%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2\%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1\%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p {$<$} 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.},

  abstract = {Suburbanization refers to the sociospatial process whereby cities expand outwards beyond their original central areas via the formation of suburbs. Suburbs are peripheral areas lying beyond a city's boundaries, but which are interconnected to the city economically and socially, for example, via commuting. Suburbanization typically involves building new homes for either sale or rent, combined with residential mobility whereby people leave the city in order to live in suburban homes and neighborhoods. Various explanations have been offered for suburbanization including transportation development, consumer preferences, uneven capitalist spatial development, class and racial social differentiation, and industrial decentralization. There is increasing scholarly recognition given to the socially diverse nature of the suburbs along class, racial, and ethnic lines. It has also been recently suggested that complex processes of post-suburbanization are occurring, as seen, for example, in the development of edge cities in the United States.},

Based on the statistical distribution of transit ridership, this study applies a suite of geographically weighted negative binomial regression models to capture the weather\textendash transit ridership relationship at both daily and half-hourly levels. The results reveal that weather exerts significant effects on transit ridership; its effects vary by passenger type and are not fixed across locations and temporal periods. In general, senior passengers are the most sensitive group to variations in weather conditions, and their responses are quite similar across the public transit service area. Morning peak hours are the period when passengers have the strongest weather tolerance. Spatial heterogeneity of weather effects mainly occurs in adult, child, and tertiary student passengers, not seniors and secondary student passengers. In contrast to suburban areas, city centres and university campuses are the locales most likely to have distinct weather responses. The results suggest that it is important for transit operators to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the weather\textendash transit ridership relationship to proactively (re)design and adjust scheduling to achieve weather-resilient performance.},

To this end, recent work has focused on mapping regions without access to places like supermarkets, often terming them `food deserts'. Until recently, this work has not considered residents' mobility as facilitated by transportation systems, and even among those that do, few have considered alternative forms of transportation, like public transit, opting for automobile-oriented travel assumptions. This paper analyzes people's spatio-temporal constraints to accessing supermarkets, and focuses on the transit commuting population. Analysis of commute data from Cincinnati, Ohio shows there are a significant number of residents that have improved access to supermarkets when a grocery shopping trip is made on the way home from work, than if they were to depart from their home location. These results extend previous work showing relatively few automobile commuting residents have better access to supermarkets given their work locations.},

Neighbourhoods with lower SES reported poorer health and more emotional distress. Perceptions of the physical environment dominated social concerns in all neighbourhoods. For all three health outcomes, individual risk factors followed expectations, with measures of poverty, age, and lifestyle all significantly associated with poor health outcomes. Physical environmental problems were positively and significantly associated with poor physical and emotional health. Specifically, people reporting they dislike aspects of their neighbourhood's physical environment are 1.5 times more likely to report chronic health conditions (OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.19 to 2.05), while those reporting physical likes with their neighbourhood are less likely to report fair/poor health (OR 0.50, 95\% CI 0.28 to 0.90) or emotional distress (OR 0.45, 95\% CI 0.26 to 0.80). , Conclusions: These results demonstrate the importance of neighbourhood perceptions as a determinant of health, as well as conventional factors such as low income, lifestyle, and age. The dominance of physical environmental concerns may have arisen from the industrial nature of Hamilton, but this result merits further investigation.},

  abstract = {Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) has been demonstrated to provide efficient and effective public transport that can even increase transit ridership and attractiveness within defined urban corridors in both developing and developed countries. The merit of the BRT system lies in its ability to provide a high quality public transit service with limited infrastructure and at a relatively low capital and operating cost. In this paper an attempt is made to review BRT characteristics in some detail. An overview of the elements of BRT systems: the running ways, vehicles, stations, as well as operational control, fare collection and passenger information systems is presented. This paper also discusses how these elements allows BRT services to achieve the speed, capacity, reliability, accessibility and operational safety characteristics that distinguishes such systems from regular express bus services. Each built BRT system is unique and depends on how these basic elements are designed and integrated. Environmental, social and economic impacts, users' perception and modal shift towards BRT have also been critically reviewed. With the presence of local land use and transport policies that support high-density and mixed developments, BRT has been found to attract potential developments around stations and along its corridor, increasing land values and promoting sustainable development. As reported in the literature, the infrastructure costs vary greatly depending on the costs of land acquisition, station design, degree of separation from traffic, technological features and material, labor costs. Thus, BRT capital costs cannot be generalized and must be transferred carefully based on the changes of the input costs that vary from one place to another. The barriers to BRT that block the achievement of significant success in customer satisfaction and ridership gains are mentioned with specific case studies. The review of BRT indicates that in some cases it has similar performance to higher order public transit; however, it still has its unique characteristics that set it apart.}

  abstract = {Several recent pilot studies combined Global Positioning System (GPS) technology with travel survey data collection to evaluate opportunities for improving the quantity and accuracy of travel data. These studies used GPS to supplement traditional data elements collected in paper or electronic travel diaries. Although many traditional trip elements can be obtained from the GPS data, trip purpose has remained an important element, requiring the use of a diary to continue. Presented are the results of a proof-of-concept study conducted at the Georgia Institute of Technology that examined the feasibility of using GPS data loggers to completely replace, rather than supplement, traditional travel diaries. In this approach, all GPS data collected must be processed so that all essential trip data elements, including trip purpose, are derived. If this processing is done correctly and quickly, then the computer-assisted telephone interview retrieval call could be shortened significantly, reducing both respondent burden and telephone interview times. The study used GPS data loggers to collect travel data in personal vehicles. The GPS data were then processed within a geographic information system (GIS) to derive most of the traditional travel diary elements. These derived data were compared with data recorded on paper diaries by the survey participants and were found to match or exceed the reporting quality of the participants. Most important, this study demonstrated that it is feasible to derive trip purpose from the GPS data by using a spatially accurate and comprehensive GIS.},

We used joinpoint regression analysis to identify significant changes in trends and multivariate analysis to examine correlates of this barrier for the year 2017.Results. In 2017, 5.8 million persons in the United States (1.8\%) delayed medical care because they did not have transportation. The proportion reporting transportation barriers increased between 2003 and 2009 with no significant trends before or after this window within our study period. We found that Hispanic people, those living below the poverty threshold, Medicaid recipients, and people with a functional limitation had greater odds of reporting a transportation barrier after we controlled for other sociodemographic and health characteristics.Conclusions. Transportation barriers to health care have a disproportionate impact on individuals who are poor and who have chronic conditions.

Limited research has studied the effects of neighbourhood age-friendliness on elderly health outcomes. Using the example of a highly urbanized city in Asia, this study examined the effects of perceived age-friendliness of neighbourhood environments on self-rated health (SRH) among community-dwelling older Chinese. A multi-stage sampling method was used to collect views of community-dwelling older people from two local districts of Hong Kong. A structured questionnaire covering the WHO's eight AFC domains was developed to collect information on the perceived neighbourhood environments, SRH and individual characteristics. Age-friendliness of neighbourhood was assessed by mean scores of AFC domains, which was used to predict SRH with adjustment for individual and objective neighbourhood characteristics. Furthermore, 719 respondents aged {$\geq$}60 years completed the questionnaire, of which 44.5\% reported good SRH. Independent of individual and objective neighbourhood characteristics, multiple logistics regressions showed that higher satisfaction on outdoor spaces and buildings, transportation, housing, social participation, and respect and social inclusion was significantly associated with increased odds of reporting good SRH by more than 20\% (p {$<$} 0.05). Individuals aged 70\textendash 79 years, being female, lower education and residents of public or subsidized housing were less likely to report good SRH, after controlling for individual and neighbourhood characteristics. In addition to age, gender, education and housing type, AFC environments have important contributive influence on SRH, after controlling for individual and objective neighbourhood characteristics.},

  abstract = {Objectives To (i) summarize the methods undertaken to measure physical accessibility as the spatial separation between women and health services, and (ii) establish the extent to which distance to skilled care for childbirth affects utilization in Sub-Saharan Africa. Method We defined spatial separation as the distance/travel time between women and skilled care services. The use of skilled care at birth referred to either the location or attendant of childbirth. The main criterion for inclusion was any quantification of the relationship between spatial separation and use of skilled care at birth. The approaches undertaken to measure distance/travel time were summarized in a narrative format. We obtained pooled adjusted odds ratios (aOR) from studies that controlled for financial means, education and (perceived) need of care in a meta-analysis. Results 57 articles were included (40 studied distance and 25 travel time), in which distance/travel time were found predominately self-reported or estimated in a geographic information system based on geographic coordinates. Approaches of distance/travel time measurement were generally poorly detailed, especially for self-reported data. Crucial features such as start point of origin and the mode of transportation for travel time were most often unspecified. Meta-analysis showed that increased distance to maternity care had an inverse association with utilization (n = 10, pooled aOR = 0.90/1km, 95\%CI = 0.85\textendash 0.94). Distance from a hospital for rural women showed an even more pronounced effect on utilization (n = 2, pooled aOR = 0.58/1km increase, 95\%CI = 0.31,1.09). The effect of spatial separation appears to level off beyond critical point when utilization was generally low. Conclusion Although the reporting and measurements of spatial separation in low-resource settings needs further development, we found evidence that a lack of geographic access impedes use. Utilization is conditioned on access, researchers and policy makers should therefore prioritize quality data for the evidence-base to ensure that women everywhere have the potential to access obstetric care.},

Data tabulated for different spatial scale levels or according to different zonal systems for the same region will not provide consistent analysis results. Since spatially aggregated data are often used not just in geographical research, but also in other social science and physical science disciplines, the MAUP has broad impacts. The MAUP effects are functions of the underlying spatial distribution of the data, and their spatial relationships to the spatial scale hierarchy and zonal systems. Several general approaches have been suggested to handle the MAUP. They include simply acknowledging its presence and possibly conducting multiscale and multizonal systems analyses to show the range of possible results. The other extreme is to develop scale-independent or insensitive analytical techniques, but it has little success. One potential direction is to develop a general framework to address the underlying processes of the MAUP. Based upon this framework, specific solutions may be developed.},

HiTs examine differentapproaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services andthe role of the main actors in health systems. They also describe the institutionalframework, process, content, and implementation of health and health carepolicies, highlighting challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis.Undoubtedly the dominant issue in the Dutch health care system at presentis the fundamental reform that came into effect in 2006. With the introductionof a single compulsory health insurance scheme, the dual system of public andprivate insurance for curative care became history. Managed competition forproviders and insurers became a major driver in the health care system. Thishas meant fundamental changes in the roles of patients, insurers, providers andthe government. Insurers now negotiate with providers on price and qualityand patients choose the provider they prefer and join a health insurance policywhich best fits their situation. To allow patients to make these choices, mucheffort has been made to make information on price and quality available to thepublic. The role of the national government has changed from directly steeringthe system to safeguarding the proper functioning of the health markets.With the introduction of market mechanisms in the health care sector and theprivatization of former sickness funds, the Dutch system presents an innovativeand unique variant of a social health insurance system.Since the stepwise realization of the blueprint of the system has not yet beencompleted, the health care system in the Netherlands should be characterizedas being in transition. Many measures have been taken to move from the oldto the new system as smoothly as possible. Financial measures intended toprevent sudden budgetary shocks and payment mechanisms have been (‎‎‎andare)‎‎‎ continuously adjusted and optimized. Organizational measures aimed at creating room for all players to become accustomed to their new role in theregulated market. As the system is still a ``work in progress'', it is too earlyto evaluate the effects and the consequences of the new system in terms ofaccessibility, affordability, efficiency and quality.Dutch primary care, with gatekeeping GPs at its core, is a strong foundationof the health care system. Gatekeeping GPs are a relatively unusual elementin social health insurance systems. The strong position of primary care isconsidered to prevent unnecessary use of more expensive secondary care, andpromote consistency and coordination of individual care. It continues to be apolicy priority in the Netherlands.The position of the patient in the Netherlands is strongly anchored in severallaws concerning their rights, their relation to providers and insurers, access toinformation, and possibilities to complain in case of maltreatment.In terms of quality and efficiency of the health care system, the Netherlandsis, with some notable exceptions (‎‎‎e.g. implementation of innovations such as daysurgery and electronic patient records)‎‎‎, an average performer when comparedto other wealthy countries. It is too early to tell whether efficiency and qualitygains will occur as a result of the 2006 reform.},

  abstract = {Low density suburban development and excessive use of automobiles are associated with serious urban and environmental problems. Master planned development suggests itself as a possible palliative for these ills. This study examines the patterns and dynamics of movement in a selection of master planned estates in Australia with the aim of developing new approaches for assessing the containment of travel within planned development. A geographical information systems methodology is used to determine regional journey-to-work patterns and travel containment rates. Factors that influence self-containment patterns are estimated with a regression model. The findings of the pilot study demonstrate that the proposed model is a useful starting point for a systematic and detailed analysis of self-containment in master planned estates.},

  abstract = {Policymakers in cities worldwide are trying to determine how ride-hailing services affect the ridership of traditional forms of public transportation. The level of convenience and comfort that these services provide is bound to take riders away from transit, but by operating in areas, or at times, when transit is less frequent, they may also be filling a gap left vacant by transit operations. These contradictory effects reveal why we should not merely categorize all ride-hailing services as a substitute or supplement to transit, and demonstrate the need to examine ride-hailing trips individually. Using data from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey in Toronto, we investigate the differences in travel-times between observed ride-hailing trips and their fastest transit alternatives. Ordinary least squares and ordered logistic regressions are used to uncover the characteristics that influence travel-time differences. We find that ride-hailing trips contained within the City of Toronto, pursued during peak hours, or for shopping purposes, are more likely to have transit alternatives of similar duration. Also, we find differences in travel-time often to be caused by transfers and lengthy walk- and wait-times for transit. Our results further indicate that 31\% of ride-hailing trips in our sample have transit alternatives of similar duration ({$\leq$}15~minute difference). These are particularly damaging for transit agencies as they compete directly with services that fall within reasonable expectations of transit service levels. We also find that 27\% of ride-hailing trips would take at least 30~minutes longer by transit, evidence for significant gap-filling opportunity of ride-hailing services. In light of these findings, we discuss recommendations for ride-hailing taxation structures.},

  abstract = {Convenience and low prices have enabled ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, to position themselves amongst the most valuable companies within the transportation sector. They now account for the lion share of activities in the platform economy and play an increasing role within our cities. Despite this, very little is known about the type of people that use them, nor the purpose and timing of trips. In addition to this, their effect on other modes, such as taxis and public transit, remains, for the most part, widely unexplored. By comparing the socioeconomic and trip characteristics of ride-hailing users to that of other mode users, we find ride-hailing to be a wealthy younger generation phenomenon. While our results show that ride-hailing is too minute and inconsequential to influence the ridership level of other more substantial modes of travel overall, when considering specific market segments, the rise of ride-hailing corresponds to a significant decrease in taxi ridership and a rise in active modes of travel. Moreover, due to the specific age, timing, and purpose of our subsample, we believe that ride-hailing may effectively reduce drunk-driving, and are convinced that as this mode increases in importance in the future, it will have a much more pronounced effect on the level of ridership of other modes as well.},

  abstract = {Governments are challenged by the need to ensure that ageing populations stay active and engaged as they age. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the role of mobility in older people's engagement in out-of-home activities, and to identify the experiences they have within their communities. This research investigates the use of transportation by older people and its implications for their out-of-home activities within suburban environments. The qualitative, mixed-method approach employs data collection methods which include a daily travel diary (including a questionnaire), Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking and semi-structured interviews with older people living in suburban environments in Brisbane, Australia. Results show that older people are mobile throughout the city, and their car provides them with that opportunity to access desired destinations. This ability to drive allows older people to live independently and to assist others who do not drive, particularly where transport alternatives are not as accessible. The ability to transport goods and other people is a significant advantage of the private car over other transport options. People with no access to private transportation who live in low-density environments are disadvantaged when it comes to participation within the community. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between transportation and participation within the community environment, to assist policy makers and city and transportation planners to develop strategies for age-friendly environments within the community.},

This study investigated the relationship between perceived neighborhood environment and subjective well-being and the mediating effect of a sense of community among Chinese elderly. Subjective well-being included four indicators: life satisfaction, meaning in life, positive affect, and negative affect. The Perceived Residential Environment Scale assessed physical and functional aspects as material conditions of neighborhood. The Sense of Community scale was drawn from the Community Social Capital survey based on urban residents of China. Seven hundred and twenty community-dwelling older adults participated in this investigation. The results showed that the neighborhood environment related positively to life satisfaction, meaning in life, and positive affect but negatively to negative affect; sense of community partially mediated the relationship between the neighborhood environment and life satisfaction and fully mediated the relationship between neighborhood environment and meaning in life and positive affect.},

  abstract = {Sprawl is a well-known consequence of the suburbanization of the United States population. However, only recently have scholars shown interest in the effects of sprawl on transportation outcomes. For example, little research on how sprawl affects private-vehicle commuting distances and times is evident in the literature. To explore further the relationship between sprawl and private-vehicle commuting distances and times, a multilevel approach is adopted. Using microdata for households and macrodata for Metropolitan Statistical Areas, multilevel models of the effects of four dimensions of sprawl on commuting distances and times are estimated for private-vehicle commuters. Results show that shorter-distance, private-vehicle commutes are associated with lower density, more centeredness, and better accessibility, while shorter-time, private-vehicle commutes are associated with more centeredness. Overall, results point toward centralizing employment as the urban planning policy most likely to reduce private-vehicle commuting times, if only modestly.},
