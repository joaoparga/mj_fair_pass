## What is their travel behavior?

### Transit use, cost barriers, and suppressed demand

The table below displays the cross-tabulations with respondents‚Äô travel behavior by their age groups, i.e., over 65 years old (Treatment) and between 50 and 64 years old (Control). Seventy percent of the individuals over 65 years old have the Free 65+ fare loaded into their Opus card. The relative percentage of people that declared riding transit as much as they liked was higher in the treatment group (73%) than in the control (66%). Nonetheless, 85% of the treatment group said that the cost of transit has prevented them from taking a trip using public transit, compared to 66% of the control. Additionally, the treatment group reported a higher percentage (73%) of respondents that declared having difficulty meeting transport expenses when compared to the control (52%). These results deserve further investigation: is suppressed demand an issue disproportionately affecting people that do not have access to the fare-free program? And how will these results change with time after the implementation of the fare-free policy? 

Regarding suppressed transit demand because of transit costs, control and treatment behavior are similar. Active modes of transportation are the most common form of replacement for those who reported not taking a transit trip because of transit cost - more than 40% for both control and treatment. Not taking the trip at all is the second most common option (27% for the whole sample), followed by using the car (24%) as the alternative trip modal choice. 

```{r dfrename}
#| echo: false
df_rename <- df_both 
data.table::setDT(df_rename)
df_rename[
  age_groups_control_treat == "Control (50-64)"
  , has_free_pass_wave1 := NA_character_
]

names(df_rename) <- gsub("_", " ", colnames(df_both)) %>% 
  str_to_title()
df_rename <- df_rename %>% st_drop_geometry()
```



# Update

## Old analysis (1st wave only (demographics?))

```{r}
# loaded free pass on card (treat and control)
df_both %>% filter(wave=="Second") %>%  count(q111, age_groups_control_treat)
```

df_both %>% filter(wave=="Second") %>%  count(q111, age_groups_control_treat)


## Update old (1st and 2nd wave combined)

Awareness of free pass and how did that translate to its use
```{r}
# 1st wave
df_both %>% filter(wave=="Second") %>%  count(awereness_free_pass, age_groups_control_treat)
df_both %>% filter(wave=="Second") %>%  count(has_free_pass_wave1, age_groups_control_treat)
df_both %>% filter(wave=="Second") %>%  count(has_free_pass_wave1_categories, age_groups_control_treat)

# type of fare (available for 1st wave only)
df_both %>% filter(wave=="Second" & has_free_pass_wave1 == "Yes") %>%  count(fare_type_before_pass_q98, age_groups_control_treat)
df_both %>% filter(wave=="Second" & has_free_pass_wave1 == "Yes") %>%  count(fare_type_before_pass_q99, age_groups_control_treat)

# 2nd wave
# has free pass loaded
df_both %>% filter(wave=="Second") %>%  count(q111, age_groups_control_treat)

```


## New analysis only (2nd wave only)
